lauradog95,"I had a wonderful stay at Colombo Court Hotel & Spa whilst working in Colombo. The staff were attentive, helpful, and friendly. The room was spacious and comfortable (great aircon and fan, and comfy bed!). Loved the pool and the Sri Lankan breakfast at the restaurant was delicious. Shout out to Chathuranga who always went above and beyond. Would stay again. Thank you!","Fantastic, comfortable experience",Colombo Court Hotel & Spa,-0.03620365856003366,0.4085732826900327
Rach-Marg,"The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive. Mohammed and Sanjith were particularly kind and helpful. 
The room was clean and spacious with excellent air conditioning and fans. The bed was very comfortable. 
The main area is beautiful and the design is very authentically Sri Lankan which is a huge plus but also partially open so be wary during rainy season. 
There were a few ants in my room but I think that is to be expected this time of year. 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and highly recommend.",Great stay! Gorgeous authentic Sri Lankan Experience,Colombo Court Hotel & Spa,-0.03620365856003366,0.4085732826900327
HED249,"Always a peace heaven when in Colombo 3, perfectly situated near to Queens road, Number 11 and Gallery café.
Each room has its charm and benefit from natural light and air openings on the lush inner courtyard.
Bespoke service is anticipated and unintrusive, so rare in these days of standardisation. Mohamed and Rifqi each time one step ahead of expectations! Kamal in the housekeeping team has a  great attention to detail and willingness to assist.

avidtraveler4444,"I have to say, I was blown away by Theva Residency. The winding roads leading to the hotel are a bit eyebrow raising, and even when you pull up to the driveway, it's still very unassuming. But we were immediately welcomed into what would become a highlight in our Sri Lanka trip.

Theva Residency is a nicely adorned boutique property in the hills of Kandy. An easy 15-20 minute drive to Temple of the Tooth and Kandy city center proper. The service was warm, friendly, and genuine from the moment we checked in. We were assigned room 7, and it was a beautiful mountain facing room, that was exceptionally large. The bed was super comfortable, and the hotel had all of the major amenities you could need in the bathroom. 

What really sets Theva apart is their ability to be boutique, but have all of the bells and whistles of a luxury hotel. While we didn't use the pool, little touches like turn down service and someone bringing chocolates before bedtime were nice touches. The food was INCREDIBLE - we had the set menu for dinner and the options were fantastic, presentation was impeccable, and service was stellar. It also helps that this property has more staff than guests so they're always looking to enhance the experience. 

I was especially blown away by breakfast - a multi-course affair with a fresh fruit plate and bread basket to start. All of which were fresh and super tasty. Coffee your way - I asked for a regular drip (filtered) coffee and it was served in a French press!

Theva is in a league of its own, and for someone who regularly stays at 5* luxury resorts, I was so incredibly surprised by how lovely this stay was.

amalk852,"Endlich schaffe ich es, diese Bewertung zu schreiben: Wir waren mit unserer kleinen Tochter im August/September 2021 zu Gast in „The Teva Residency“ (soweit reicht die Tripadvisor-Datumsangabe leider nicht zurück). Während dieser Zeit gerieten wir in einen mehrwöchigen Pandemie-Lockdown und waren irgendwann die einzigen Gäste. Wir hatten ein sehr schlechtes Gewissen, allen so viel Mühe zu bereiten. Dennoch haben sich die Mitarbeiter einfach rührend um uns gekümmert! Sie waren unglaublich freundlich und der Service blieb auch in dieser Zeit einwandfrei. Das Team hat uns immer wieder mit neuem, ausnehmend gutem Essen überrascht (nachdem wir die sehr leckere Speisekarte mehrfach durchprobiert hatten) und hat wirklich alles getan, um uns den Lockdown so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Der Einsatz des ganzen Teams und auch ihrer Chefin war wirklich außergewöhnlich! Vor allem unserer kleinen Tochter wurde wirklich jeder Wunsch von den Lippen abgelesen. Obwohl die Lebensmittel zu dieser Zeit im Land immer teurer wurden, schaffte es das Team immer wieder, ihr die geliebte Teva-Schokoladentorte zu backen. Als wir dann endlich abreisten, bekam unser Kind Spielzeug geschenkt und eine Torte als „Wegzehrung“ überreicht. Die Puppe wird auch heute noch in Ehren gehalten und meine Tochter mag seitdem keinen anderen Schokoladenkuchen mehr, weil keiner so gut schmeckt wie die „Teva-Torte“. ;-)  
Die Menschen in Sri Lanka sind alle unglaublich freundlich, aber das Team von „The Teva Residency“ gehört für uns wirklich zur Spitzenklasse!",Spitzenklasse,Theva Residency,-0.21735542598990248,0.4085732826900327

The food here was great. It was authentic, aromatic, delicious. The taste of the food was just amazing. 

The hotel was on top of the mountain so the view from the hotel was just mind blowing. The ambience of the hotel was excellent. 

The staff was so well mannered.

Recommended food: Thai green curry with rice, Soup of the day served in the bread bowl, baked white onion with cheese toast soup, Theva special rice and curry served with 17 authentic srilankan curries, Theva wattalapan pot, Home made Icecream, Battered fried fish with salad.

The hotel is nice and small, however the penthouse main room doesn’t have curtains all the way which was an issue for us as our kids were sleeping in that room.

CH1LDS1E,"Rooms were of poor standard (we were shown 3 before we had to choose one or have nowhere to sleep) - bathroom was tiny and bath looked old and tired - and it was extremely slippery.  The male hotel receptionist was not helpful when we told him that the room was not what we expected for the amount of money we had paid and he just kept saying you'll need to contract your travel agent.   We'd been touring Sri Lanka and had stayed a many hotels during the tour that were meant to be of a similar standard, but sadly this place was lacking.

There a very tiny pool, that we did not go in.  The only saving grace for this hotel is the food, which we really enjoyed and the restaurant staff were extremely attentive.

We contacted our travel agent to get us moved to the original booked hotel (Grand Kandyan) on the second night and much preferred our final stay in Kandy.

Just as were were leaving a very kind lady showed us to a beautiful room and said we could have that on our second night if we would like to stay.  If all rooms were like that, we would not have had such an issue.... but sadly they don't show you the poor rooms on their website.  

What a shame that it turned out like this as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it certainly put a damper on things.",Not the best experience,Theva Residency,-0.21735542598990248,-3.1121113872985475

sameeras828,"This is my first time visit to Jaffna and decided to go for a reputed hotel chain to stayover and to have meals. Since my experience was excellent in other hotels of the Jetwing chain, decided to select Jaffna Jetwing.

I stayed overnight, had lunch at the restaurant and dinner with drinks at the rooftop bar.

The experience, in a nutshell was amazing from the reception of the hotel to the rooftop bar. Staff were friendly and efficient although they look very young and new to the trade.

Would recommend anyone visiting Jaffna to select Jaffna Jetwing.","The experience, in a nutshell was amazing",Jetwing Jaffna,-0.4719048922922184,0.4085732826900327
lird5,"We were welcomed with a cold towel and wood-apple juice. Our room had a view to the lagoon and the fort which we appreciated. It was good being within walking distance of the sights we wanted to see. The restaurant is very nicely set out with the buffet options well displayed. The staff are very attentive. But even in a top hotel the food was far from hot, except for the dishes cooked especially for you. The Jaffna Night food buffet was excellent with so many different tastes (although one soup was far too spicy for us). The restaurant was full that night but there were no issues accessing the food. There are two lifts so there was little waiting even on 6th floor. Reception staff were helpful in changing money into smaller notes and providing an extra bed sheet for one of us who found sleeping under a doona too hot.",Great view,Jetwing Jaffna,-0.4719048922922184,-0.7649882739728273

However, they can’t deal with things or fix things quickly eg broken hairdryer took an hour to fix and despite asking 5 times for a temporary hairdryer for the interim they actually wouldn’t supply one.

I actually asked to be let into my brothers room however they never checked my credentials so anyone can enter your room. Be warned.

We enjoyed the best of service from everyone we met. They had only 2 buffets while we were there, due to low occupancy over weekdays; however a la carte and set menus were really good.

Consigliato anche per il rapporto qualità prezzo.
Manca la quinta stella perché il servizio di ristorazione è gravato da molteplici tasse arrivando al 35% non espressamente indicate nel menu (si parla genericamente oltre tasse) e questo non mi pare corretto perché durante il nostro tour nei menu, laddove presente, era sempre specificato il 10% di service charged. Qui, invece bisogna aggiungere oltre al 10% il 18% VAT e il 2,5% tassa di soggiorno. Insomma una birra da 1000 rupie da menu la pagherai effettivamente 1342,00 rupie e così  le pietanze.

Z939QHpetrag,"The swimming pool is located on the roof of the hotel and looks nice. The swimming pool is not suitable for families at all. There are too few sunbeds and no parasols and it concerns a small area. Very inconvenient for us with many children. We booked 3 days but wanted to leave the same day. Unfortunately, we did not receive any cooperation from the staff. The result was that guests looked annoyed at the children whenever they splashed something.
The rooms are fine. The bathroom feels a bit small, but the shower is spacious. in the bathroom there is a handy drying rack right above the toilet? Not useful at all. The beach is not suitable for sunbathing and was full of tar during our stay. The amount we paid for this hotel was much higher than what we spent in the past 2 weeks at six other hotels that had better quality than this hotel.

rameshl744,"As the Director of Cricket at Hibiscus Coast Cricket Club in New Zealand, I had the pleasure of staying at Regal Reseau Hotel Negombo during our U19 cricket tour in Sri Lanka, and I must say it was an outstanding experience.

Firstly, I was impressed by the high-quality service offered by Regal Reseau. The room standards were exceptional, providing us with comfortable and luxurious accommodations throughout our stay. The room service was prompt and attentive, ensuring that all our needs were met efficiently.

The laundry service was also top-notch, which was greatly appreciated as it kept our team's uniforms clean and fresh for our matches. The breakfast options were diverse and delicious, catering to everyone's preferences with plenty of choices available.

One of the highlights of our stay was the superb swimming pool located at the top of the hotel. The pool area was well-maintained and provided a relaxing space for our team to unwind after intense cricket sessions. Additionally, the nightly live music or entertainment added a lively atmosphere to our evenings, making our stay even more enjoyable.

I’ve worked in luxury hotels in NYC for over twenty years and I am familiar with the standard operating procedures that are required to get star rating and I have to say that the staff went above and beyond meeting and anticipating expectations.

The rooms were subtle and minimal which i love and housekeeping was superb!!! The rooftop bar and food were excellent and I want to compliment the chef and everyone in food service. They are attentive, efficient and always smiling.

Where to start!? We were met by caring staff who took our bags and gave us a cold fruit juice. After the briefest of check ins we were taken to a well stocked immaculate room, so clean and tidy overlooking one of the two pools. After a few drinks at the pool bar we had a buffet dinner. The choice was spectacular, freshly cooked and so tasty. Breakfast the next morning was of a similar high standard.

We had full board and the breakfast and dinner were served from an extremely extensive buffet. Breakfast was one of the best I’ve seen in a hotel in Sri Lanka. Lunch was selected from a menu and was vey filling. On dinner they had some music performances which was great. The dinner buffet was also very good with amazing selection.

A y réflechir , il y a sûrement de meilleurs options pour le logement sur les nombreuses collines de Kandy mais la restauration restera un grand moment de nos vacances , en particulier le dîner de la Saint Valentin ( 13,000 roupies net de taxes à deux ... ie  40 euros ) . Le repas du midi et les petits déjeuners étaient excellents avec un choix continental ou local . La chambre quant a elle s'est révélée assez bruyante , en particulier avec les équipes de nettoyage qui ont démarré très tôt le matin (  7h ) et n'ont pas arrêté de parler très fort au lieu de nettoyer la chambre contigue . Aussi la décoration et le mobilier sont très très minimaliste me faisant penser à un mobilier IKEA recyclé . Ceci dit , comme toujours au Sri Lanka le personnel est très aimable et attentif . Autre point négatif , pas de Spa à l'hôtel ( possibilité de faire venir un masseur pour une personne ... donc pas extra lorsque on est en couple ) .

My wife and I are returning after a few years, and the staff are friendly as ever, the food was delicious, and oh that view 😍 

We thoroughly enjoyed our albeit short stay, went for a walk in the environs and took a stroll to the top of the hill which boasted spectacular view and came back to the property for a wonderfully chilled swim in their private pool 🥰 

Theva truly offers a serene and tranquil atmosphere that is perfect for a relaxing getaway. 

The lush greenery surrounding the property adds to the overall charm and beauty of the place. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, providing a cozy retreat after a day of exploring. 

The attention to detail and personalised service at Theva is truly exceptional.

ngaikay,"We were first presented to a room without a balcony and sea view which didn’t match the description of my booking. When I brought out this issue, the hotel staff said the rooms were fully booked. I insisted in getting a room that matched my booking. We waited for a while and they finally gave me a room with balcony and a bit of sea view.
However, the room is so old that definitely needed some renovation. The air con fan couldn’t work probably. There were drippings from it. Their towels got some stains too.
From my observation, there are old wing and new wing building in this hotel. I don’t know what are their criteria on where to put the guests but we were put in the old wing building. 
They do have a nice pool facing the beach but the rooms really letted us down.
The room costed around $78 per night and I didn’t expect the quality like this. Very disappointing.","Old hotel, not value for money",Camelot Beach Hotel,0.001276017459939349,-3.1121113872985475

The location of the property is with out compare, tucked away just at the bottom of Little Adam’s Peak / across the road from 9 Arches Bridge with views for days.

cbal96,"This is by far the best hotel we have stayed in whilst touring Sri Lanka. The stunning views, the chilled vibes, the peaceful atmosphere and owners/employees that couldn’t do more for you! The room/cabana was spotless, the bed super comfy and the shower actually running piping hot water - this place also comes with good shampoo/conditioner (not tester size). 

Breakfast is included and is served outside on your balcony where there’s a table, hammock and coffee table with 2 seats. It really couldn’t get any better! There are beers and water in the fridge, with the family-owned restaurant at the bottom of the steps. It served amazing food and very cheap with large portions. They even bought the food up to our balcony! 

The hotel is situated at the very start of little Adams peak trek, making it easy to wake up and catch the sunrise! We loved this place and would tell anyone to stay here whilst in Ella!! It’s perfect for couples and we wished we could have stayed longer. ",Best hotel in Sri Lanka,The One Ella,-1.002086142658085,0.4085732826900327

Culture532259,We had 3 days at this hotel before flying home ...sadly it fell way below par ...we wanted rest and relaxation after a hectic 2 weeks and on arrival we were told it would  take about 20 mins to finish the room ...we were hot and not offered  a drink or cold towel ( which is offered every hotel weve ever visited in sri lanka and over 3 days we watched many visitors given this ritual)..on given our room we settled in and after dinner which was a buffet and sadly quite cold went back to our room and realised that there was a live band playing in the rooftop bar (with drums) and VERY loud ...at 11 we had to phone and ask how long till the  end and it was midnight which also meant tgat people coming back to their room were shouting and noisy in corridors and rooms..the service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow if ordering drinks last day we had no wifi and the keycard locked us out ..we had a problem with the butter that was used here which was piped and frozen ..it stank and was very unpleasant my wife had eaten some before realising and had a very poorly tummy for 2 days ..the second night they had a dj on same again till 12 and the 3rd night we had a guest above us moving furniture across the room and balcony all night we had called downstairs but to no avail ...we had to leave at 6am for airport so had no sleep that night ..they were suppose to give us a packed breakfast and when at airport found mine to be 1 boiled egg with shell ...2 small pieces of bread a banana and carton of juice ..my wife is vegetarian and got 3 small pieces of fruit and a juice ..it all went in the bin ...this was our honeymoon and we wished we had never gone here ...this is advertised as a 4 star hotel but the furniture is tatty the bathrooms  very small balconies ...needs some work  we would never go back,Disappointing stay,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,-0.8904279411819157,-3.1121113872985475

The hotel itself is a pretty standard hotel, not very special in itself. What makes it good is the view over the beach and sea and the friendly staff. The drawback is the food. We had half board so perhaps the a la carte menu would have been more interesting. What we got was fairly boring westernised food (cauliflower soup, a pasta dish, chicken in 'chicken nuggets' style.

Siesta838,Really nice hotel just back from the beach at Negombo.. Beach is poor and in my opinion Negombo is only suitable for a stop on arrival or before departure at the airport.. However... You need to be aware that the prices quoted for drinks/meals etc are subject to Hidden taxes.. Yes 10% is normal in Sri Lanka but this hotel Charges 15%..then taxes on top... This works out at a whooping 33%...a beer will cost 1000rps..when you add the taxes it will be 1333rps...same with meals.. Very expensive by Sri Lankan prices. Nice rooftop pool area.. But management please make your hidden charges available for all to see rather than at checkout when it is too late... ,Nice Hotel but Be aware of HIDDEN charges.. ,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,-0.8904279411819157,-1.9385498306356874

avidtraveler4444,"I was absolutely blown away by our recent stay at 98 Acres - arguably one of, if not the best hotel in Ella. 

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted and quickly checked in. We were given a traditional Sri Lankan blessing/welcome and quickly shown to our room - 100 - which had stunning views overlooking the mountain range and valley below. The room was beyond spacious and featured a super comfortable bed, and a massive bathroom with walk-in shower. I really appreciated the resort's emphasis on sustainability, as all of the bathroom amenities were in recycled packaging and also seemed local/homemade. The property tries very heavily to not rely on or utilize plastic where possible. 

The entire resort is situated cliff side, ensuring that each room has impeccable and unobstructed views. It was so remarkable to wake up each morning and just sit on the balcony as the sun was rising, and just being in nature. Natural sounds of birds chirping, tea pickers showing up for work and starting their day, etc. Just remarkable.

We used the pool area, which is nicely set up with lounge chairs, and day beds. It was also a great place to order a beer and cocktail and continue taking in the views. 

While we were only at 98 Acres for one night, both dinner and breakfast were included in our package and both were awesome. Dinner was from a set menu, and the restaurant was a perfect place to eat a tasty and sizable meal, with the choice of being indoors or outdoors. Breakfast was buffet style, and had a wide array of options which was enjoyable. Satith was our server for breakfast and super attentive and also encouraged us to try the tea - which is from the resort's own tea plantation - and that little touch / recommendation made the stay that much more memorable. 

Before departing we did have the opportunity to visit the spa and have a 60 minute massage. It was AMAZING - the spa rooms overlook the tea plantation making for a good view at the start, and our massage therapists were fantastic. The massage was exceptionally affordable (by US standards), but highly recommend making reservations early or right at arrival. We didn't expect the spa to be booked up, but it was, and we had to settle for a 9am appointment on our departure day. 

Highly recommend 98 Acres - by western standards it's a 4 star property that is very much operating as a 5 start facility. Their attention to detail (down to bestowing a bag of their house tea to each guest at departure) was noted and so appreciated. More than anything, the genuine service of the staff is what left a lasting mark on us, and if we find ourselves in Ella again, this will be where we call home again.",A Highlight Of Our Sri Lanka Trip!,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,0.4085732826900327

However,  I found the quality of the hotel very average for the very high coat of staying here. They are certainly making the most of the great location they have and are charging accordingly.  Bed sheets and bath products okay but have been using my own, drinks and food in the hotel are very expensive,  it's so much cheaper to get a tuk tuk into Ella and eat at one of the many good restaurants.

anuradhin2024,I would like to post the terrible experience we had at this hotel. This was one of the worst hotels we stayed at due to very unprofessional service provided by the staff of the hotel and complete lack of attention to detail. Any request that we made fell on deaf ears. The A/C in the first room that we were given was not working and we had to move our bags on our own to another room which again did not have an in-room telephone nor any of the amenities that come in the room for tea/coffee.  The manager also had the audacity to come and ask us to pay for two drinks in the mini-bar which we had not taken before even checking the room at check out.

tanzinanik,"Check in was delayed by two hours. Waited for an hour and then was moved to a temporary room for the second hour. WiFi didn't work - router challenges. 

Primary concern was -  If you call for transportation through ride apps - the drivers are scared to come pick you - because there are tuk tuks outside the hotel who will apparently beat them. Raised concern to hotel. Staffs response was its not their responsibility. These drivers parked at their hotel entrance have no affiliation with them. They asked me to either pay the transportation at the hotel gates - at higher rates - or walk out of their hotel on foot with my luggage if I didn't think it was right.  

When I pointed out - this affects their guests directly and is their responsibility as well to an extent. The staf literally pointed me to to the exit. 

Maybe its a general challenge for all hotels here. Regardless it was a negative experience over all - specially considering this is a 5 star rated hotel.",Room for improvements,Thaproban Pavilion Waves,-0.706152867417049,-4.285672943961408

The free airport transport is an excellent service. Our driver who was very professional helped us with getting sim cards at our request a real gentleman.

The service in the hotel is what you would expect in a five star city hotel, it was completely unexpected.

And the hidden gem in this hotel is the chef. OMG! The food is to die for. The best curry I've ever tasted!  Carters for gluten free. As mentioned we spent our last day at an expensive hotel but the food wasn't a patch on Belmont. So we walked in the end our trip on a high at the Belmont for a taste of the most delicious food.

RPK254,"1) Nice boutique hotel centrally located for the beach and buzzing bars/restaurants which were walking distance from the hotel. Many of these bars/restaurants had live music in the evenings.
2) The Bathroom had really hot showers, which for me is crucial especially when you need to shower 2 or 3 times during the day due to hot climate/beach visit. It just makes your visit relaxing.
3) As it is a stopover hotel for tourists moving on to their next destination in Srilanka, most opt for b&b as we only saw a few people at dinner(we were on HB). Because of this, the menu was a la carte both times and options a bit limited(especially for vegetarians). However, if you want something special/different made for you, you can request it the night before and they will happily oblige. They cooked vegetarian Kottu for us which was really delicious.

WanderlustSNW,"Visited the Tiki bar for the first time. The food did not disappoint. 
The drinks and service were a different story however. For a person who detests egg, finding RAW egg white froth in the cocktail which had no mention of egg white whatsoever in the ingredients was quite a damper on the entire experience. In the menu all the cocktails had a list of ingredients and egg white was mentioned in some. After specifically opting for a beverage which had no mention of egg, that horrible smell and taste of raw egg was much to my disgust. Hotels and establishments of this level of reputation should be very careful about what they serve their guests. Specially something like raw egg. The worst part was, the staff were very casual about this. Like it was no big deal.

I am deeply disappointed with my experience as a member of Shangri-La Colombo. While I have been a long standing member and have even referred several business associates to join, recent events have left me questioning the value of this membership and the quality of service provided.

Several months ago, I misplaced my Apple Watch and access card while using the gym facilities. It took three months for the management to return my watch which I am sure they had but couldn't be bothered giving even after multiple requests, and, even more frustratingly, I am still waiting for a replacement access card after nearly six months. Despite informing the gym manager about the issue three months ago, there has been no resolution. The front desk staff repeatedly claim the card is “being processed” or “in the process of being issued/printed,” but this level of incompetence is beyond acceptable, especially for a so-called 5-star establishment.

- Romesh Tuk Tuk driver - Romesh was an experienced driver and showed us local areas safely and with great knowledge of Colombo. He was always happy to greet us and made the experience memorable. 
- Lakshan (Room Service) friendly chap who was happy at his job. 
-Ravindra (front office) - in discussion about our trip, he went out of his way to provide us with a list of places to visit in Nuwara Eliya. He was a good ambassador for the area with his vast knowledge. 
-Fazmeer Mohideen (Restaurant Manager) was a delight to speak with and would continuously spoil us with authentic Sri Lankan dishes which were variations of the menu. When he found out my daughters like certain foods, he got the chef to provide us with another dish in a unique style, which they loved. If there were any issues with the food, Fazmeer managed to resolve it and protect the brand.",Shangri La living up to their luxury reputation,Shangri-La Colombo,0.7657052429506364,0.4085732826900327

saaliyat,"on the 28th July 2024 AM 10.07 (aprox) My self (being the photographer), and lady who the heads a marketing dept in leading business magazine along with the writer (lady), we were invied to come by a client of ours (house guest at the hotel) for a business interview. Once we arrive the property around (Aprox 9.40AM) from the security division were stopped and strictly instrucetd to wait outside. The security devesion didn't allow us go pass the checkpoint to the lobby simply because we had photography gear with us. They treated us like a bunch of terorists have come to take pictures of the entire property. Even after 20 mnts passed neither the reception or the RM or who ever arranging the meeting room with our client/house guest had no decency to inform the security to let us in and wait at the lobby until arrangements are being finalized to proceed with the meeting. The security never interested in communicating our presence to the inhousestaff to let us in to the lobby.  Both the ladies had to constatnly go and ask security whether we can go in and wait. They insisted we are not allowed to go in with cameras. By the time we went in at was around 10 .10and all our mood and momentum was a dissare due to unprofessional behaviour by the Shangri La front office staff. Which came to our mind, Shangri La so called a “star class hotel “ have decided no guest can bring a camera to their property OR to you bring a camera you need prior approval OR you better be prepared to wait outside.

 It was so sad how the Shagri La staff treats their guests, it was clearly evident that Shangri la thinks who ever comes to their property is a terorists not guest. It is so sad, such a multinational organization hires so uneducated people as staff. Shangri La management either should hire people with brains or if they hire ideots at least should train them to use their brains in situations like this. 

Such a disappointing multinational !!!¬",Front office staff kept us waiting outside for 30 mnts in hot sun!!,Shangri-La Colombo,0.7657052429506364,-4.285672943961408
Road801650,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Shangri-la Colombo last week. The Shangri-la Colombo is a well-maintained modern hotel. It is by no means a “grand”hotel but what it lacks in age and history, the Shangri-la makes up for it by taking care of its guests very seriously. We were very well taken care of right from the moment of our arrival at the hotel. Although it was our first trip to Sri Lanka, the staff received us as if we were old friends (thank you Radinka and Hiruni). When it was time to depart, the staff took time to say their goodbyes, even presented us with a souvenir and waved us off (not all guests make use of faceless expressed check-outs). In between our stay, we had the benefit of a busy mall so that we never needed to leave the hotel if we wanted to. This desire for guests to have a restful stay (and perhaps for a few nights imagine they were truly in Shangri-la) is not to be taken for granted. The Tripadvisor is full of examples of luxury hotels falling short of expectations because of poor service. Long may this positive guest-first attitude stay on with the Shangri-la.","Thank you, Shangrila",Shangri-La Colombo,0.7657052429506364,0.4085732826900327

The food and beverage at this hotel is in a league of its own. We had the pleasure of meeting Moshan, who amongst other staff greeted us at breakfast every morning. They went above and beyond to ensure we had all that we needed every morning. Best part of our day was being greeted by the food and beverage team. Breakfast buffet was on another level!

Lolly1972,"The hotel is spotlessly clean, and very genuine, warm greeting on arrival. The rooms are a little small for three, but has most amenities that are required. Housekeeping was efficient and twice a day. 
The breakfast has a good selection, and the Capital   grille serves amazing food. However it was so very cold with the air conditioning despite asking them to turn down the fan numerous times. We also were not allowed to sit in the bar with our 12 year old, as this is the rule in Sri Lanka, but as an option they offered us to sit outside which did not appeal as it was old furniture and not a very appealing view. 
The pool was ample, but small, and luckily for us not too crowded as wouldn’t have imagined if all people wanted to attend at the same time, there would be no free chairs. 
The breakfast is vast and plenty of choice, but service is a little hit and miss.

Simba_SVG,"Jetwing Jaffna is a good hotel but it's nowhere near a 4-star hotel. At best its 3-stars. 

Location - Situated in the heart of Jaffna near all the tourist places and city centre. Very easy to get to. There is a supermarket right next to the hotel and a food court. Can't get better than this. 

Staff - The staff are lovely and diverse and speak several languages. They also worked together really well. But, the receptionist got my credit card details wrong from booking.com and couldn't charge my card. So I had 5 different staff constantly interrupting me while I was trying to eat dinner. They probably thought I was going to eat and do a runner. I wish the staff and trained better on how to treat customers in these situations. It was awkward. The reception is always empty and the staff are always away for some reason. 

Food - The food is authentic and tasty. Especially Jaffna dishes. But the cold selection is poor. It was confusing too. They had everything from noodles to bacon, pancakes, eggs and pizza for breakfast. The weirdest breakfast combination I've ever seen. The staff didn't tell me or show me around so I ate noodles for breakfast without knowing there was a buffet with Srilankan food. Instead of them trying to do everything they should stick to one theme. The dinner was nice but x5 expensive than some of the resturants charge near by. They even charge 5000 rupees for a toddler.

Rooms - The rooms are clean. But, there are maintenance issues. The hot water didn't work, I had to call reception to get someone to fix it. But, it turns out you need to open the tap in a certain way to get hot water. It was bad and I ended up showering in the cold. But, other than that the bathrooms are spacious and clean. There aren't any room service so you buy some snacks. 

Overall it's a nice little hotel but not worth the price. I would return because there aren't any other hotels in Jaffna with this standards.",Decent hotel but room for improvement.,Jetwing Jaffna,-0.4719048922922184,-3.1121113872985475

P1244EOrichardp,"My first-ever experience of Sri Lankan accommodation, before learning more about the country (I'm now a veteran - 6 days and 3 accommodation locations in!)

Jaffna is less affluent than some other Sri Lankan towns/areas/provinces, partly because of the long 80s-00s civil war. With this as an underlying caveat, the Jetwing hotel was excellent - brilliant base location; professional staff; great accommodation; sublime, extensive food options for breakfast and lunch.

We didn't do A La Carte dining - instead, pizzas and drinks on the unexpectedly mosquito-free rooftop terrace, which is a lovely place to wile away 2-3 hours. But I have zero doubt the dinner would have been fab too.

I'm very hard pressed to find any ""improvement point"" for the Jetwing, given the Jaffna setting - they had a delicious wedding anniversary chocolate cake to greet us in our room, how lovely? - so the only thing is ""would have appreciated an armchair in our room"".

The only issue we encountered was the need for greater cultural sensitivity regarding the buffet layout. It would be preferable for pork items to be kept separately to respect all cultures.

MarkE806,"This review is a tale of two halves. The hotel is perched high above Kandy with views over the surrounding hills. It’s a very pleasant spot and the outside terrace is a great place for a breakfast. The interior is attractively furnished and the glass surround allows for full appreciation of the views. The menu was quite diverse and reasonably priced and all the food we had in two nights and two breakfasts was tasty and interesting. We asked for a medium level of spice and got deliciously spiced dishes that were just right for our palates. 

The rooms in the hotel are described in the guide book as minimalist. I think they veered towards stark and aren’t helped by below par finishing. Ours was spacious with a large and comfortable bed and reasonably sized balcony. The whitewashed concrete walls lent it rather more of a bunker feel than I think the designer was aiming for. It was further let down by an aged A/C unit, a cheap, plastic, ill-fitted toilet seat and a generally cheap feel to the finishings.",Excellent food in a lovely restaurant above rooms that have veered from minimalist to stark.,Theva Residency,-0.21735542598990248,-0.7649882739728273

The staff were kind as all Sri Lankans are, but the hotel is super tired and it was such a disappointment to us that we curtailed our trip by a night. Although the room was fairly clean, the furnishings were very cheap including the bathroom. The word is everywhere looked tired.  The food was disappointing too which is a shame as the outdoor terrace overlooking the view is lovely.  Maybe this hotel was good once upon a time, but it needs a very serious makeover, as it has huge potential because of its location high up on the hill. It was sadly the worst of the hotels we visited in Sri Lanka. ",Disappointing hotel,Theva Residency,-0.21735542598990248,-1.9385498306356874

DBrody,"I would recommend Theva Residency to anyone visiting the Kandy area. It is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in, in terms of views and friendliness.

The room - large enough, good air con, large balcony with a beautiful view and good seating. Has a fridge, safe etc. Comfy bed. Strong shower, we had a bath too. WiFi can be a bit temperamental in the room.

The hotel - beautiful surroundings! Views from all windows are great. Very clean. It is up a mountain so you do need a tuk tuk to get in and out of Kandy itself but this is pretty easy to arrange either on PickMe app or the front desk will arrange one.

Pool area - there is a lovely infinity pool (3ft to a max of 5ft depth) with 6 loungers, towels provided. We never had trouble with getting space. There is also a sauna!

Also the staff are really helpful, friendly and nice. The manager helped us arrange some excursions and made things really simple for us.

The breakfast is delicious - choice of a continental style eggy breakfast or Sri Lankan breakfast.

The restaurant is lovely, but some of the meals were a bit hit and miss (personally found the nasi Goreng and fajitas quite bland) but you can't go wrong with any of the curries!

Our hosts were brilliant - extremley welcoming and friendly, always there to help with anything and even organised a safari tour for us at a great price. They had thought of everything - Sri Lanka was having regular power cuts in the evening whilst we were there, and our villa had a very helpful torch which we took out with us in the evenings (the hotel had a back up generator so we were never without power there).

Set in the tree tops the views are gorgeous and bird life fabulous. It is out of town (very uphill but quite walkable for us) so the advantage is its' peace  and quiet.

There was, a fridge safe and tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. The swimming pools, yes there were three, with two reasonably large pools and a small one. All of them were well maintained and clean. The only thing I would say as it was busy during our stay, a few more sunbeds and especially parasols would be useful.

The rooms are spacious and well-maintained, providing a comfortable stay. The staff are generally polite and attentive, ensuring that guests feel welcomed and looked after. The pool area and other amenities contribute to a relaxing experience, making it a good choice for travelers seeking peace and natural beauty.

However, there is room for improvement when it comes to the dining experience, particularly during breakfast. The restaurant staff, while courteous, could improve coordination, especially in managing services like tea and coffee. On busier days, such as when the hotel is fully booked, the team should plan ahead to accommodate the increased number of guests efficiently. Better organization during peak hours would significantly enhance the dining experience.

Alissa1727,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per una notte, durante il nostro tour in Sri Lanka. Siamo arrivati alle 15, accompagnati dalla nostra guida, che ci ha fatto il check-in, nel mentre ci facevano accomodare sui divanetti e ci davano una salvietta rinfrescante.
Quando siamo arrivati aveva iniziato a piovere, quindi non abbiamo potuto usufruire del servizio piscina esterno, anche se, da come abbiamo visto, era molto organizzato con sdraio e salviette date dalla struttura.
Ci hanno, quindi, accompagnato in camera dove abbiamo trovato un ambiente accogliente e pulito, se non fosse che in una delle due camere scendeva acqua dal soffitto cadendo proprio sul letto. Hanno cercato di risolvere la situazione, ma alla fine hanno optato per spostare il letto in un’altra posizione (davanti alla finestra). Nelle camere è disponibile anche il bollitore per il tè. Unica pecca sono le porte di ingresso, da cui entra luce e si sentono i rumori esterni.
Avendo programmato il festival di Kandy alle 18, abbiamo lasciato l’hotel alle 17, per rientrare poi alle 22:30, orario in cui finiva il buffet della cena. Una volta arrivati era ancora disponibile, ma sinceramente non ci piaceva nulla di quello che era disponibile (cibi troppo speziati o piccanti), così abbiamo chiesto di farci degli hamburger e nel giro di un quarto d’ora ce li hanno portati al tavolo.

KumaraKK,"Our family vacation at Jetwing Jaffna in December 2023 was a delightful experience that exceeded our expectations in many ways. We stayed for two nights in their deluxe room, which provided a comfortable and spacious retreat for our family.

Location and Atmosphere: The hotel’s location is its standout feature, being conveniently close to the city center while also offering a serene and calm atmosphere. This balance was perfect for our family, allowing us to explore Jaffna with ease while also enjoying peaceful moments at the hotel.

Room and Amenities: The deluxe room was well-equipped, comfortable, and maintained to a high standard of cleanliness. However, we felt the addition of a couple of chairs in the room would have been beneficial, providing extra comfort and convenience.

Rooftop Bar and Dining: A highlight of our stay was the rooftop bar, offering a stunning 360-degree view of the surrounding area. It was a unique spot to unwind and take in the sights of Jaffna. The food options at the hotel were reasonable, catering to diverse tastes and preferences.

Service: The restaurant staff members were incredibly friendly and efficient, contributing significantly to our positive dining experiences. Their warmth and professionalism were notable and appreciated. Additionally, the WiFi connection was up to standard, and we were impressed by the staff's willingness to provide a separate 4G router free of charge upon request.

Areas for Improvement: While most of the service was exemplary, we did feel that the front office and security staff at the entrance could improve in terms of friendliness. As the first point of contact, their approach is crucial in setting the tone for guests’ stays. A more welcoming demeanor from these staff members would enhance the overall impression of the hotel.

Conclusion: Overall, our stay at Jetwing Jaffna was a memorable part of our family vacation. The hotel excelled in location, atmosphere, dining, and service, making it a commendable choice for families visiting Jaffna.

459aselat,"A good place compared to other locations in Jaffna, we stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. We usually stay in Jetwing hotels when we travel, this hotel lacked the level of service that we have seen in other Jetwing hotels. Rooms are smaller, hot water was not working and AC was noisy. Staff needs more training in customer service all the way from the security at the entrance to GRO, and restaurant. (staff are friendly and nice but lacks the skill we have seen in other Jetwing hotels). In the restaurant when requesting for service they pass the message to someone else and then the service never happens, (only one or two of the senior people responded fast) this was seen with other guests as well. The choice of food was good but it did not change much for the 3 nights we stayed, (it repeats faster). The location is convenient and we reached all our destinations in a short period of time.","Good location, service can be better.",Jetwing Jaffna,-0.4719048922922184,-1.9385498306356874

311aselap,"It was a very nice welcome. The front desk employees welcomed us with a traditional Jaffna welcome known as Pottu, which involves applying ""Kunkumam"" and ""Chandanam"" dots to all our foreheads.
Each and every employee you encounter will go above and beyond to extend a genuine smile. There's no getting away from it. Regardless of the individual, they carry it out.
The meal was delicious. The buffet was incredibly well organized, and there were plenty of options on the ala carte menu as well.Every mealtime was meticulously supervised by Mr. Attukorala, the chef extraordinaire. On Jaffna night, the buffet was really good.

I still recommend experiencing the buffet even if you choose to stay somewhere else. 

A roof-top pool is a nice addition to the experience, but other than that, everything was great.

Jagathgun,"I chose Jetwing Jaffna for my first visit to Jaffna. My wife and I  visited Jetwing Jaffna on the 26th October for 4 nights initially and extended our stay by one more day as we loved the place.
The place is centrally located in the city of of Jaffna and easily accessible to most traditional sightseeings. 
The welcome reception was exceptional.  The front office staff waited (including the GM Nilanthi) for our arrival with traditional Jaffna style welcome of Pottu” is the application of a “Kunkumam” and “Chandanam” dot adorned on the foreheads on my wife and me.
Every single staff you come across would take an extra effort to greet you with a sincere smiling face. You cannot escape it. No matter who the person is... they do it.
The food was excellent.  The buffet was exceptionally well spread and even the ala carte menu had a variety of choices. 
The well experienced chef Athukorala was personally supervised the service during all meal times.  The Jaffna night buffet was great. I recommend to tryout the buffet even if you stay elsewhere in Jaffna. 
I drove an electric car which required charging.  Though a dedicated charging point wasn't available,  all staff got together and made it happen. 
Jetwing Jaffna is exceptional value for money. 
I have no hesitation to recommend this hotel.

The attention to detail and level of professionalism displayed by your staff was truly commendable. We were thrilled to see that despite the passage of time, the hotel has kept its reputation intact and even surpassed our expectations.

In particular, we would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to Manager Gokulan for his exceptional leadership and dedication. Gokulan, your efforts in training and nurturing the younger members of your team have not gone unnoticed. The level of service they provided was nothing short of remarkable. It was evident that they were both well-trained and passionate about their work, and this made our experience even more enjoyable.
The technical team that was on-site throughout the event also deserves special mention. They were incredibly attentive and proactive in ensuring that all our technical requirements were met. Their promptness and expertise in handling any issues that arose were truly impressive. Please convey our gratitude to them as well.

Pros=A city type hotel in the heart of jaffna with Jaffna fort,Nallur temple,Jaffna Library very close by.Many thanks to the kitchen staff  who provided a wonderfull cake which was a nice little surprise awaiting in the room.Staff was very freindly and helpfull.A super market & KFC outlet is next door,which will be very helpfull.
Cons=Jaffna night buffet was sub par. Hope you will add some international cuisine at least for the desserts.Many of the desserts were actually local sweets rather than desserts which is not ideal for a dinner. Moreover Salad section is also hopeless. I know it is ""Jaffna night"" but still i think you guys have OVERDONE it little bit.(because we knew you guys can do better with meals after having that very delicious cake)
Tips=if possible request for a lagoon veiw room. Dont forgert to visit roof top where you can have birds eye veiw of jaffna.

The rooms are beautifully designed and absolutely clean, we got the room with the whirlpool and jungle-view. It was really beautiful!  Overlooking the rainforest there is a pool and also an outside area with sunbeds and tables to enjoy the surroundings. Then there is plenty of space inside, like the play-room, sauna and restaurant if it's raining. The meals were delicious! And all the dishes were served like a piece of art! I appreciate all the effort, that was put into preparing and decorating the wonderful food. Loved the dessert as well.

We stayed in a lovely big room with giant windows overlooking the rain forest and the town in the valley. Super view! We could see the sunset directly from the bed! The room is very stylish and has lots of nice designs incorporated. I really liked the jacuzzi directly in the room. Everything was on top level: cleanliness, food, service, location. I also loved the meals! Before we didn't have a very high opinion of Sri Lankan food, I thought it is only rice and noodles. But I at Thevas I found out, that I was totally wrong! For dinner I ordered a Sri Lankan local dish and it was amazing! I got about a douzen of different local currys and vegetables. I found out, how diverse food on Sri Lanka actually is. For breakfast, as well, I took the local menu and was surprised to get so many different things served. It was very tasty! Also I really appreciate that there were plenty of vegetarian dishes on the menu and the cook was even ready to adapt a dish to my preferences and make it vegetarian. The food by itself is a masterpiece! The cook decorated and served every dish with such care and originality. (Also don't forget to try the desserts! 😉) The environment at Thevas was so calm and relaxed. We would love to come again and enjoy this beautiful place in nature!

MyRsrvtions,"Theva Residency is a property that I have been waiting to visit for a long time and finally got the opportunity last weekend.

We were allocated the spacious, panoramic penthouse which has gorgeous, sweeping views of the Hanthana mountain range. The rooms come with all luxury amenities such as Bathrobes, bedroom slippers, fully stocked mini bar, beautiful eco friendly drinking water bottles and unlimited tea and coffee.

The suite has its own large dining table, living area which is perfect to watch the morning sunrise and beautiful decor.

The bedroom has the same gorgeous view of the Hanthana mountain range and the bathroom comes complete with a lovely jacuzzi. Spa Ceylon bath products are provided as well.

The staff and service was impeccable! Tuan an Upeka greeted us and promptly showed us to our room even though we arrived earlier than expected in the morning Kandy train. The property is just 2.5 km from the Kandy railway station and if you opt to travel by public transport, the resort will assist you to be picked up and comfortably brought to the resort so you don’t have to haggle with the Trishaw guys around the station who don’t have a meter.

The cuisine was to die for! Everything was beautifully plated and presented and each bite was simply sublime! Kudos to the team of chefs at Theva for doing a flawless job and even letting us order items which are not on the menu! We requested takeaway sandwiches for our train journey back to Colombo and it was nearly packed in a takeaway box and bag, which was so convenient.

The property also provides sundown cocktails or mock-tails so you can have a romantic drink outside on the terrace whilst enjoying the cool mountain breeze!

This property is extra special to me because they grow most of their own herbs and spices within their gardens and also have some funky potted plants using up-cycled plastic mega bottles. Quite a unique and neat idea which I have not seen anywhere else so far.

The pool is pretty and also overlooks the mountains. Perfect for a sunny afternoon dip!

Thank you Tuan, Upeka and team for making us feel so welcome and at home during our stay! A special thanks to Dheeshana who coordinated the entire stay with me and even checked on us via Instagram even though she is the owner of the property and was based in Colombo during that time. That’s what I call personalized service! 
We will definitely be back and hope to see all you beautiful souls again very soon!

We selected grill chicken with smash garlig potatoes but what they served boiled curry chicken.  When we so our displeasure the restaurant manager has interfere and ensure to give some quality food. Grill fish n vegetables.  Thanks for his prompt response.  Next two days buffet breakfast and dinner both was good. Not much choice but good quality and tasty food. There rice and curried ( Prawns and vegetables) for lunch is good. Staff are very polite and attentive to guests. Specially to mention restaurant staff Pradeep and front office staffs and house keeping staff were very friendly and helpful.

They were not bothered about in-house guest and keep playing loud music until 2am early morning.  It is very much annoying attitute.  Have to call Reception and Residence manager but music never stopped and gone after midnight. Spoke to some guests at breakfast area and all were unhappy about this.

RonSachathep,"My friends and myself booked the 98 acres hotel upon going through most of the reviews about the property and it really lived upto our expectations. The check in was smooth and fast, staff at the lobby and check in counter were attentive and courteous. The property is situated on a high mountain top and the property grounds are huge with a commanding view of the surrounding valley and mountains. A superb location for nature lovers. The most important point that every future guest booking this property needs to be aware of is there is no air condition in all the rooms. Its more of an eco friendly property and the weather in Ella being mostly cool, i guess the room fans does most of the work even though all of our group friends and myself were pretty taken aback at there being no aircon in a 4 star hotel.
The rooms were spacious with a big balcony overlooking the tea fields below the rooms and the mountain ranges view right ahead, the only issue about the rooms are the amount of bugs, insects and small moths that quickly make their way into the room even if the balcony door is opened for a short period of time, very inconvenient to myself and my friends,m especially at night before sleeping .
The overall staff that handles the buggy service to and rom the rooms , the dining staff were all courteous and helpful to all our needs. Breakfast was good with quite a few varieties of dishes available. The hotel spa was a nice relaxing experience, very reasonable with a commanding view of Adans peak. The hotel is about 3 km from the main town of Ella where all the restaurants are situated, not very far by car. There is the Ravana zipline and the Ravana Pool Club next to the hotel premises, plus the walk or hike to Adams peak starts a bit further down from the hotel so thats an added bonus to the guests .

traceyrJ9878NQ,"Seriously, don't waste your money. There are so many reasons, I will need to use dot points!
- there is no air conditioning and no fly-screens, only a fan. It gets HOT in Ella, so we were grossly uncomfortable the entire stay (it is in the hills, so bugs everywhere)
- the rooms are NOISEY! There is a HORRENDOUS club within a few minutes walk of the property, and you can hear the thud-thud of music all day and into the night. It is truly awful. When we arrived (after many emails requesting a quiet room), we were placed in a downstairs room with a group in the room above us. The rooms have timber floors so the scraping of furniture and walking was incessant. There were also builders directly under our balcony, using a circular saw, so all the dust came up in to our room. After MUCH discussion, we were finally allowed to move into a different area of the property. While you couldn't hear the horrible music from the club, it still wasn't near to being peaceful and relaxing. 
- the tv is in a small little area off to the side. The fan does not reach there and the sofa is very hard. A gecko lived in the ceiling, so we got pooped on twice! You cannot see the TV from the bed. 
- there is a very busy road going right through the property. There are people and tuk-tuks travelling along it at all hours.
- the majority of the rooms are all on top of each other - there are 4 rooms to a double storey building with wooden floors, so the noise is awful.
- but, one of the main reasons we would never step foot in this place again is the owner and his son and daughter-in-law. We went for dinner in the restaurant and the owner and family were also dining there. They waltzed in with their young daughter - maybe 4 years old, and two nanny's. While the owner, son and daughter-in-law sat down to eat, the nanny's and little girl were left without food or drink in the lounge area. The parents quite literally had their backs to her! The little girl created havoc in the restaurant and was being chased everywhere by the nanny - it was after 8pm, so the poor little girl should have been in bed. The parents ignored her, and every time she tried to go near them, they turned her around and called the nanny to come and get her! The entire dining room was disgusted! The mother was too busy trying to be gorgeous, and the father was on the phone half the time. 
- The owner obviously went for style (although there wasn't much) over substance, because the entire place was extremely impractical and uncomfortable. They obviously don't care about the experience of their guests, only the money they bring in.....thus building a loud, tacky club right next door!","NOT relaxing, NOT luxury, don't waste your money!",98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,-4.285672943961408

AlisonJDawe,The accommodation and especially the hospitality of the staff employed at the Belmont Boutique Hotel makes for a wonderful place to start and end your tour of this beautiful island nation. We had 2 days to settle in to life in Sri Lanka before going on an 8 day tour with a private driver. The hotel is 20 min  from the Int. Airport and close to the beach as well as  lively bars and beach restaurants. The area is easy to explore on foot and very safe. That said you must try the Sri Lankan dishes on offer at the hotel - the chef is fantastic as are the waiting staff and front desk. After our tour we decided to re-book and return to spend our final couple of days with people who genuinely care about their guests.

Food wise they were plenty of good options. We loved our dinner at Capital Bar & Grill which offered a great selection of meat and seafood. The steak was perfectly cooked to our preference. The cocktails and wines selection was good. The buffet at central for both breakfast and dinner has a wide variety of local and international cuisine and was great quality for a buffet. Finally the snacks at the lobby bar were perfect for a light lunch with a view.

457udayaj,Shagri-La car park could probably be the worst ever confusing car park in hotels/malls right now. To top it all they charge exhorbitant prices for parking and even if you dine in and pay a huge bill at one of thier restaurants. Do not expect to be treated kindly by their parking attendents if you forget to bring the token from the restaurant. Showing the restaurant bill is not enough (btw no one tells you about the token before you enter or at the restaurant itself).,Worst ever car park and rules,Shangri-La Colombo,0.7657052429506364,-4.285672943961408

It was over looking the valley and the mountains and our bed was super comfortable, we really appreciated the turn down service before bed. The place was peaceful and the staff went above and beyond. The bartender made great drinks- highly recommend the house cocktails. We had breakfast and dinner, the food was great and well priced. 

The infinity pool was one of the reasons why we booked the resort and it met expectations. It was clean and it was a bonus to find out they had a sauna and steam room!

storiesbysoumya,"I totally loved my stay at the Theva Residency. My room was enormous with an in-room jacuzzi that looked out at the mountains. It was elegantly furnished and I had candles by my jacuzzi, which added a really sweet touch.
I loved their steam and sauna too. Even though, I was short on time, I made sure I relaxed in the steam room and came out rejuvenated. They have a nice pool if you wish to take a dip. 
Since I am a foodie and am always looking for good food, I totally adored the spread at Theva Residency. Their Sri Lankan spread was delicious. Egg hoppers, string hoppers, the parippu curry, and the sambols - all were delicious. Plus, you get to eat in an open-air restaurant/or inside glass doors which means you can enjoy the gorgeous scenery while eating.
Service at Theva Residency is extraordinary. They will always go the extra mile to make you comfortable. ",Absolutely gorgeous place with the most amazing views.,Theva Residency,-0.21735542598990248,0.4085732826900327

Sandya-and-Erik,"Okay a few small things to take into account; eg. the remote location is not for everyone, not all rooms have balconies, and the infinity pool long ago lost its infinity views due to growing trees and scrubs.
But the standard room was quite good already, and the Penthouse suite out of this world. For only double the normal room price you get 4 x the size, a large double jacuzzi bath, and splendid views.

We arrived at the hotel in an evening and I was fascinated by the view from the outside lobby area, where I could see the entire Kandy area from the top. We were greeted so warmly and my kids got so friendly with the staff within few minutes.
The room was spacious clean and equipped with all the necessities and the view from the balcony was also stunning. The food and the service from the staff have been exceptional.
The surroundings of the resort is ideal for relaxation and being close to the nature. All we could hear throughout is birds chirping and the feel of the cool breeze.
We also throughly enjoyed the sauna and the steam bath located alongside the infinity swimming pool and also not to mention the spectacular view from the pool.

The food was super delicious and sufficient portions were served. Only à la carte option is available. Make sure you taste their homemade ice cream which is too good and specially the ones we tasted Avocado and Passion fruit were just flawless.
Friendly and welcoming staff. Special mention Mr. Wasantha (F&B Operations Manager) who’s doing a great job with his team. 
There’s a game/ entertainment room with plenty of indoor gaming options such as billiards, darts etc plus good collection of books and movies too. In addition to that, there’re sauna and steam rooms available as well.
Pool area is open to the view of mountains which gives great pleasure during a swim.

The shower area and basin also had water accumulation, and the kettle for heating water was rusted. Although the staff did attempt to fix the locks, it was only after I contacted my travel agent that the hotel agreed to change our rooms.

It is a very convenient place to stay in Sri Lanka.. The staff is excellent and we received such personal attention from all of them- from the front desk staff, to bell boys, restaurant servers, and all others. They were attentive, courteous, and very helpful. 

We did a few day trips on our own and the staff gave us great advice where to visit and likewise arranged a car with driver/guide at a very reasonable price. The perfect way to get around our drivers was very helpful and thanks a lot both to hotel staff to see to this and likevise the drivers genuinely friendly and helpful.
 
We shall visit Sri Lanka again hopefully soon. And yes off course we shall stay at Belmont Hotel we do already look forward to our next visit.

It was prefectly prepared, tasty and servings generous. Needless to say we had dinner a few evenings at the hotel since food was so good. 
Breakfasts made to order and very good too. 
Our room was very comfortable. The bed´s just right for us and we sleept well. 
We also loved the rooftop area it had beautiful views and also a bar area.

There are quite a few restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. 
The ones we visited where all worth a visit. Good food and friendly staff.

Highly recommended. Good value for money.    Sorry for late review!

Lv2Teach,"We recently stayed here for one night and loved our stay. It was a very convenient place to stop for one night after we landed in Colombo and were driving further the following day. The staff is excellent and we received such personal attention from all of them- from the front desk staff, to bell boys, restaurant servers, and all others. They were attentive, courteous, and very helpful. Mahinda took great care of us and provided excellent service. After we got there, we took a short walk to the beach. The beach is  a bit disappointing- sort of dirty. But still worth a quick visit. There were many restaurants around that area, but we decided to eat dinner at the hotel. The meal was absolutely delicious! It was freshly prepared, very flavorful and had generous amounts. The breakfast the following day was made to order, and very good too. Our room was extremely comfortable. The bed provided very good sleep. After breakfast we checked out their rooftop area that had beautiful views and a bar area.",Great stay!,Belmont Boutique Hotel,-0.9622639868868638,0.4085732826900327

They offer both local and western delicacy. You must try their fresh seafood dishes. the best I ever had . 
Rooftop terrace is my favourite place in evenings.

Aber: Die Zimmer wurden nur oberflächlich gereinigt. Durch die Mosquitos, die scheinbar von anderen Gästen auf dem Bett verschlagen werden, waren auch auf der frischen Wäsche (und Handtüchern) getrocknete Blutflecken. Der größte Minuspunkt sind die Preise, zB 800 Rupie für eine Kokosnuss (normaler Preis 100 Rupie); Wäscheservice für 10 Tshirts, 2 kurze Hosen, 4 Paar Socken, 5 Unterhosen 30$ mit Aufschlag, wenn man es nach um 10 abgibt 60$; Abendessen über 15$ während tolle Restaurants ca 4-8$ für tolle Gerichte verlangen.","Okay, aber Preise sind unverschämt.",Camelot Beach Hotel,0.001276017459939349,-0.7649882739728273

medhate2017,"We looked for a hotel to spend the night before our flight next morning to avoid traffic in the busy hours.  It was just 20 minutes to airport and was not busy at all.
Our room was on the ground floor and it was a long walk with some steps from the entrance but they helped with luggage.  I preferred a room with a balcony but there was no lifts. 
Room was very tiny but that was OK for a night .
Mosquitoes were very hungry at night and the mosquitoes repellent they plugged in was empty. 
There was tissue paper only in toilet but the regular desk or bedside boxes weren't in stock. 
Breakfast and dinner were buffet with varieties that will suit everyone. 
I did not use the swimming pool or beach. 
In second thought,  I would have been a better idea to choose even a smaller facility or family run businesses near the airport if it was only for the night and will not need the beach or pool. ",Night near the airport ,Camelot Beach Hotel,0.001276017459939349,-0.7649882739728273

The dishes were great, every single one of them were really good, we had to try them all. The night went well, the beds are very comfortable and the night quiet, we slept well and were well rested to start our day the next day. Breakfast was as good as the dinner was.

Q6824SW_,"Отдыхали в ноябре 2023 года . 
Мы были в приятно удивлены  . Отель на вид не большой , но очень красивый и чистый .  Вай фай бесплатный ,мы жили на первом этаже и у нас работал хорошо . В основном проживающие в этом отеле были иностранцы . Мало россиян  . Так же если подняться на 3 этаж там был бар где вечером можно было посидеть и полюбоваться  красивым видом . Мы ходили на массаж всего тела , нам понравилось все было в отеле , на ресепшен был прейскурант с ценами . 
Уборка в номере производилась два раза в день утром и вечером каждый день . Были все необходимые вещи зубные щетки , бритва одноразовая, палочки для ушей , пластырь , мыло , шапочки одноразовые. 
Персонал отзывчивый и приветливый . Всегда улыбались спрашивали как дела ? 
Хоть мы не владели языком , но если возникал вопрос ,то общались через переводчик и прекрасно понимали друг друга , некоторые фразочки персонал знал на русском языке . 
Вид был прекрасный ,два бассейна . У нас были завтраки мы не привередливы к еде , все было вкусно , возможно не очень большой выбор всего , но нам нравилось , мы не оставались голодными . 
До пляжа идти минут 7-10 , по комфортной дороге 
По пути встречаешь павлинов , борундуков и обезьян .Когда  приходишь на пляж там по всей береговой линии располагаются кафе где можно покушать соответственно лежаки бесплатные , есть отдельные меню на русском языке если слышат русскую речь. 
Пляж сам чистый убирают , вода чистая , прозрачная . 
Так же по пути были кафе и магазинчики . Где можно Было поменять деньги по выгодному курсу . 
Мы переживали что будет грязно, но улицы все убирают , хоть и мусорок там не встретишь . 
Тук туки были на каждом углу , мы ездили на пляж с черепахами минут 10 от того места где мы жили . Там свободный вход , на усмотрение можно было купить водоросли и покормить черепах . Это восторг , поплавать с черепахами. Людей много конечно , но всем хватает места что бы покормить и поплавать с ними . 
Нам очень понравилось все , начиная от природы , заканчивая нашим отелем .

La ropa y las toallas se amontonan. Venden pulseras blancas, rojas, verdes( la nuestra) moradas y amarillas, convirtiendo esto en un resort de vacaciones de dos estrella.

petitbijou77,"This hotel is wonderfully situated and the views are stunning. The staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming. The rooms are spacious, Clean and comfortable. You can walk easily to Little Adam’s peak. 

Unfortunately all of the above is marred by the heavy building works. Restaurant, pool all closed for renovation. Which we knew about - but there was also more building work around the rooms. Which meant you could not easily relax on your balcony and enjoy the views because of the sound of building from 8am - 6pm. We were placed next to a new block build. 

The upgrade to Ravana pool club is not an upgrade in our eyes. Unless being by a pool with loud music and drunk backpackers is your thing. Not a great environment for people with children. 

This is the only hotel - which on check out did not ask us how our stay was or to give feedback. It’s because they don’t want to hear it. 

This will be an amazing place once all the building has been finished and pool is open again. It’s a beautiful spot. It’s just a shame that the above distracted from the positives.",Mixed feelings,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,-1.9385498306356874
Cintrus,"Our stay at 98 Acres Hotel in Ella was absolutely fantastic! From the moment we arrived, we were mesmerized by the stunning views of the lush tea plantations surrounding the property. The hotel’s design beautifully complements the natural landscape, creating a tranquil and picturesque atmosphere. Riding to our room in a golf buggy added an extra touch of excitement for the whole family.

Our room was spacious and beautifully decorated, equipped with modern amenities and a cozy ambiance. The large windows provided breathtaking views of the mountains and tea fields, making every moment special. Relaxing on the large swinging ottoman while listening to nature was truly amazing. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night’s sleep. It’s worth noting that none of the rooms are air-conditioned, but we didn’t find it necessary, as the temperature was around 18 degrees at night.

The staff at 98 Acres were exceptional—always warm, friendly, and eager to help with any requests. The dining experience was delightful, featuring a diverse menu that showcased delicious local cuisine alongside international favorites. Each meal was thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented.

The location is perfect for exploring Ella, with easy access to popular attractions like Little Adam’s Peak and the Nine Arches Bridge. After a day of hiking, it was wonderful to unwind in the serene environment of the hotel.

Unfortunately the hotel restaurant and pool area was closed due to renovations and we were given access to the pool and restaurant in the next door Ravana Pool Club instead. We were not informed about this until the day of check-in which is really bad, they should have atleast emailed all guests about such a change. The Ravana Pool Club is a party place with really loud music during the day. It is not a relaxing pool experience,  which we were expecting at this resort. But we raised our dissatisfaction with the staff and we agreed on a compensation. They were understanding and apologetic about the situation.

TravellingHaNSurgeon,"Not sure if I can think of the words to describe how unbelievably spectacular this place is.

From the moment you arrive you are tended to by gracious, friendly, attentive, dutiful staff. They really went out of their way to ensure we were well looked after at all times, and they treated our little boy (coming up to 2yo) in such a friendly and heartwarming way. Clearly the hotel has a warm and family-friendly culture.

The views from our room (and everywhere on the premises) are impossibly beautiful, none more so than from the pool club. The pool club offers stunning vistas overlooking glorious mountains and valleys (ie: the same landscape you would see from Adam’s peak). The hotel is relatively prohibitive in terms of prices for rooms so the guests are typically older (as in, not teenagers on a gap year) but the bar pulls in younger travellers who have climbed the peak. 98 acres caters for this group in a very creative and savvy way by making it more of a young and club vibe, with live DJ set and decor to match the crowd etc. Not to everyone’s taste but it didn’t detract from our experience.

The food is amazing, especially the local cuisine, and despite what other reviews have said, we found the bar and restaurant staff to be thoroughly friendly and lived up to expectations (and beyond).

Although this place doesn’t market itself as a wellness retreat, with the surroundings it boasts, it could well be. Our room didn’t have aircon but the temperature isn’t unbearable thanks to the altitude, so the fan alone sufficed. Overall we could not have enjoyed our time more, and we only wish we were staying a bit longer. We’ll be back!

Thank you, 98 acres, for being a highlight of our time in your beautiful country, and playing host to some cherished memories which we will treasure!",The most incredible place you could imagine,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,0.4085732826900327

Service vs value

The staff at reception is welcoming and the first contact is warm.
We discover our room and wow, very nice (freshly build). The view is breathtaking, clean, smells good, the bathroom is huge and the bedding is comfy and qualitative. All good so far.
You have a direct access to mini Adam’s peak and several activities like zipline, swing, etc.

We go to the restaurant for the diner and begins the disappointment. First, this bright and horrible automatic light oriented on the tables is really annoying, but seems normal to everyone. We could see in other guests’ eyes we weren’t the only one annoyed.
The staff is kind and smiley, do their best to please you but it is obvious that there were given either zero or a very light training. Give these guys a proper high standard hotel training please!
The breakfast is even worse as you discover that the restaurant is in the middle of the shop, the place were people from outside are meeting, you feel like in kind of a lobby. Really not pleasant. 
When you pay ~300usd the night, you expect something at the level of the price, and for this part, we are far, very far from it.
To conclude the “what to improve”, cleaningness. 
The hotel is ok, but you have to leave the hotel space to go to the restaurant and let’s be clear, it is full of rubbish (paper, plastic,…). Quite disappointing for a high-range hotel in Sri-Lanka and one of the best in Ella.

Overall, experience is pleasant, but leaves a bittersweet taste for the price you pay vs the service you get.",A mix between wonderful and disappointing experience,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,-1.9385498306356874

Nos hicimos unos masajes, pero aunque nos gustaron, los masajistas tenían las manos bastante ásperas y el spa nos pareció bastante feo y decorado sin gusto, parecían camas de hospital.
Nos gustó mucho que tuviera el Ravana Adventure Park porque te permite hacer muchas actividades divertidas mientras estás hospedado. La piscina y el jacuzzi tienen vistas a las montañas, muy bonitas.

AnthonyP998,"A beautiful resort hotel with absolutely stunning views over the valley.  

As a resort hotel, it has quite a lot of rooms and a largish restaurant.  As such, the food, whilst good, is a little more mass produced and therefore not quite as good as some of the smaller more boutiquey hotels we stayed at.  But it's only a short tuk tuk ride into Ella town which has a number of fun upmarket back packer style restaurants and bars and a cluster of quite nice touristy craft shops.

The hotel does a great buffet breakfast which you can eat out on the terrace with spectacular views.

The hotel is also right at the foot of Little Adam's Peak which is a good easy walk taking around 30 minutes to get to the top from which there are great views.

I have no doubt Dom, the owner, offers the best option for a ""not too expensive"" nights accommodation in Ella. The room was spotlessly clean and clearly quite new. Mosquito nets round the bed were a welcome sight as it was pouring down for most of our stay. The bathroom was very clean and functional. Some shower gel may have been a good addition. The views from the room were fabulous ( when the rain ceased for a time) I really liked the location which is a distance from the main street which I did not like at all, far too touristy and clearly catering for the many backpackers who were staying in Ella.
Dom was charming and extremely helpful. He strives to offer his guests the best experience. Breakfast was perfectly adequate with the usual fruit plate, fruit juice, eggs and toast plus of course tea. One Ella is found at the start of the path to little Adams peak. I would recommend One Ella to anyone caring to have a night  or more in the town. There is a plethora of grotty looking accommodation so I think One Ella stands out from the crowd.

The owner made lots of the wooden items in that villa himself and was really helpful - even giving us a lift into town in his tuk tuk.

Ella itself was one of the more touristy places we visited, so there were lots of westerners there - and they were literally all in the Chill Cafe at night - good food and chilled music - more of a backpacker vibe than other places we went.

pepevarela1955,"Located in a hillside, it has a spectacular view of the valley. The room is nice and has a  beautiful terrace from where to see the valley and the little Adams peak. A very quiet place, only disturbs in the morning by the birds. The people who attend is very friendly and helpful.

Robohas,"Fabulous place. This little boutique hotel consists of 2 villas and if your lucky enough to secure one for yourself you will not be disappointed. They have everything you could possibly want with the most wonderful views. Dom who owns this place cannot do enough to help. For example we had no ice so he went and got some for us and the tonic to go with our gin.  The villas sit side by side over looking a tea plantation. We arrived after dark and we woke up to the most fabulous view with the tea pickers out in the field. We went with friends so we had both villa’s. But if you just wanted one villa it isn’t a problem as there were privacy screens that you could slide across if necessary. There is a lovely terrace with a hammock and comfy chairs. In the morning Dom would put both sets of tables together so that we could breakfast together. Breakfast was good and consisted of omelettes, fruit and toast with tea or coffee all served  a proper tea service.
I can not recommend this place highly enough. The villas are a little out of town but easily accessible in 5 minutes by tuk-tuk. ",Dom’s The One,The One Ella,-1.002086142658085,0.4085732826900327
danushke2010,"The One Ella"" as the name suggests probably the best place you can stay in Ella. The room is a state of art design which has given the thoughts of very detail of comfort and relaxation. The mediterranean architecture and the design of the room gives you a feeling of a luxurious private cabin. That mesmerizing view from your bed is something unique you should experience in Sri Lanka. 
Mr. Dhammika (The Proprietor) provides you the utmost care and always helpful and attentive. He even walked us to the nine arch bridge, such a wonderful person. 
""The One Ella"" is on the path way to little Adams  peak and there is a hidden path behind the hotel to the nine arch bridge. It was amazing to walk through the pine trees and that small wilderness. Good choices of restaurants are few yards aways and you can get arrange the secured parking.
Overall, we had one of the best service and leisure experience in this little hidden gem in Ella. Real value for money.",It's The One,The One Ella,-1.002086142658085,0.4085732826900327

We really enjoyed sitting on the terrace and enjoying the sunsets. The bedroom is spacious and bed very comfortable, also very quiet at night. 

Location is great - you can walk in to Ella town centre in 10 mins or get a tuk tuk for 200lkr. 

Breakfast was beautiful and plentiful. 

Clint and Dom were so kind and looked after us amazingly. They bent over backwards to ensure we were comfortable and happy. We haven't seen such incredible service in many other places on our travels.

ElleRoseOKeefe,"My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights and we wished we could’ve stay longer. The One consists of two cottages with an incredible view of Ella rock.

The hospitality right from the beginning was nothing short of amazing. Dom (the owner) and Clint (his assistant) go above and beyond to ensure your stay is unique and unforgettable. Dom was always offering advice and would assist in planning our day to day activities, as well as organising guides, tuk tuk drivers and train tickets. Breakfast was amazing and the fruit juice is out of this world. 

The room itself was perfect, clean and modern. Very new facilities. The attention to detail from Clint ensured you felt right at home within the cottage.

We can not recommend The One enough. If you have the chance and are lucky enough to secure a place, look no further. We will never forget our stay here.

sgilj,"The owner Dom is just superb: Friendly and helpful. Booked train tickets for us from Ella to Kandy. Gave advice about things to do and where to eat. He really gave our trip to SriLanka an head off start: Thanks Dom!

Accomodation is local and family driven. Consists of two private cabins. Located just outside Ella downtown, just a 200 LNK tuk-tuk drive or about 15 min walk. Its location is perfect for a walk to Nine Arch Bridge and Little Adams Peak. Can also highly recommend cooking lesson at Honey Bee Garden just across the street. Book in advance.

Accommodation otherwise was nearly perfect: 
- Bathroom is very nice indeed.
- View and private terrace was amazing. A really nice place to start your day with an excellent served breakfast. Recommend you try the SriLankan breakfast, fantastic.
- Our bed was a somewhat wiggly and made a lot of noise when turning in sleep. We slept a bit bad because of this, as I turn several times in sleep. But as everything else was so perfect we actually forgot to let Dom know, sorry Dom. As Dom read this I am sure he will fix / improve right away. The furniture is all handmade by his creative ideas and specification.

Vanaf het bed heb je een prachtig uitzicht op de bergen. Het enige minpunt was het bed. Het matras is niet heel best, het was nogal doorgelegen. We werden daardoor niet heel fit wakker. 
Het balkon is genieten, we hebben daar veel gezeten en genoten van het uitzicht. Het is een rustig plekje, op wandelafstand van de restaurantjes en winkeltjes (10-15 min bergafwaarts) en het is een goede plek voor de klim naar little Adams peak.

tuppence88,"What can I say. The most perfect place we have ever stayed in. And by far the best in Sri Lanka. 

There are only two cabins, so if you’re looking for a hotel this isn’t the place for you. However, we like peace and quiet, so it was idealic!

The cabin is quite spacious. It has a king size bed with mosquito net, powerful air conditioning, mini fridge, sufficient sized bathroom and a lovely big porch. On the porch there are two comfy chairs, racks to dry your clothes, table and chairs (for breakfast) and outdoor lighting. The cabins are very modern which we really enjoyed. The hotel doesn’t offer dinner, but if you don’t want to venture too far there is a place at the end of the road. 

A lovely man gracefully carried or very heavy suitcases up the steep stairs from the road. He asked what time we would like breakfast (consisting of omelette, fresh juice, tea/coffee, bread, butter and jam and a massive fruit platter). The gentleman was so helpful, and when he saw us drying our clothes on our makeshift washing line he kindly offered to dry them on the other side as it had more sun. When we came back from our day they had been neatly folded and left on the patio. 

If you are wanting to climb little Adams peak, you can’t get any closer than this hotel! It is where taxis would drop you off to begin the journey up (although tuktuks can get closer). It was lovely having climbed this to come back to breakfast laid out beautifully on the table. 

It takes about 10 minutes if that to get to Ella train station. 

The view is stunning as you are high up and look over mountains. You can see little Adams peak and Ella rock from the room. It’s very peaceful too. 

Few of points to note...if you struggle with stairs this isn’t the place. There aren’t many stairs but they are steep (around 30-40stairs). And if you like a busy night life, lots of restaurant etc then you will have to venture further afield by tuktuk or taxi. Also, we didn’t have hot water, despite it saying it did have it. We found that the hot water and air conditioning main switches outside the room had been switched off which we weren’t too happy about. Also, once the gentleman worker goes home, there is no one around if there’s a problem, such as loosing your keys etc. It might be worth considering an emergency contact number for any problems.

wing_wingggg,"The owner Dom provided a super friendly welcome to The One Ella and showed us our room.  The décor is superb with a great mix of polished concrete and lots of wood making for a calm and relaxing stay.  You have great views from your balcony and bed making it difficult to leave - spectacular late afternoon / early evening when we had a short storm pass through.

The One Ella is located an easy walk or short tuk-tuk ride from town - when arriving look for the Ella Flower Restaurant and the path towards Little Adams Peak - there is a small sign on the left hand side for The One Ella and the steps take you up to the two rooms.

Our breakfast was served on the balcony each morning by either Dom or his assistant and was a perfect way to start the day.  Dom was also very helpful with providing us with tips for our daily activities.

JAKSJR,"We stayed at The One Ella for 3 nights and were so pleased we did as it was absolutely wonderful and our favourite guest house in Sri Lanka.
It’s around a 10 minute walk from the centre of Ella just beyond Adams Breeze.  Our driver drove a couple of KM beyond the property before calling Dom the owner for directions. The bungalows are at the start of the pathway to Little Adams Peak, next door to The Spice lodge.
Currently 2 free standing bungalows which were built around 12 months ago. Polished concrete floors throughout including the gorgeous bathroom, king sized bed and minimal furnishings although a TV and a couch were due to be added the week after we left. Our room was spotlessly clean, modern and comfortable and we loved it.
The balcony overlooking Ella Rock and the valley was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed eating breakfast out there each morning and relaxing at every opportunity although as so much to do and see in Ella we would have loved more balcony time.
The location was perfect being so convenient to Little Adams Rock and the beautiful 9 Arches Bridge. We dined at Adams Breeze which was a minutes walk, otherwise we walked to the town centre which was an easy walk or a couple of minutes by tuk tuk.
Dom was so friendly and welcoming and was the perfect host. He got us into a cooking class run by Matey Hut which was excellent and he also arranged a very nice and very safe driver to take us to our next destination Tangalle.
A big thanks also to Clint who amongst other things made us breakfast every day (best juice ever). Such a lovely man and lovely that he is so highly regarded by Dom.
We would love to return to Ella one day just to stay at The One Ella .
I hope your plans to expand sometime down the track Dom become a reality- your vision sounds amazing.
Until we return, thank you and I know your gorgeous property will continue to be successful. See you again one day.

DeLaLittle,"Stunning interior, very professional and hospitable staff. My room was lovely and very comfortable. I booked in only really to sleep off a long-haul flight so I didn’t have a chance to make use of most of the facilities. I did sleep really well - I didn’t hear a sound from any other room, nor the exterior for the entire 1.5 days. Just a couple of gripes. I ordered a bottle of ordinary white wine, two small bottles of water and three juices to be delivered to my room and it cost over $100. No food. My choice not to bother converting the price in rupees to dollars as I was too tired but that seemed extortionate to me. It may be the going rate but I don’t stay at five star hotels often (or when I do, my husband pays!) Also the breakfast buffet looked wonderful if you have no dietary restrictions but for someone who cannot eat dairy there wasn’t much substantial to choose from. I did order eggs but they were cooked in butter so I had to leave them. Some more vegan options would be great. Bit of confusion with the pre-authorisation being deducted from my credit card even though I stipulated upon check in that I intended to settle in cash as I was worried I was maxed out on my credit card.

462ishadia,"I visited Central Restaurant for their buffet on March 2nd, and as always, it was an exceptional experience. I am a regular guest at this establishment, and I continue to be impressed with their offerings.
I cannot speak highly enough of the quality of the food. Every dish was superb, especially the Japanese cuisine and the assortment of Sinhala sweets. The desserts, in particular, were outstanding. I found every item to be equally delicious, and I have no complaints whatsoever.
However, I do have a small suggestion for improvement. While the pork dumplings were excellent, I would appreciate it if the restaurant could also include chicken or vegetarian dumplings to cater to those who do not consume pork.
The service at Central Restaurant was exemplary. The staff made us feel incredibly welcome, and the hospitality extended by THAKSHILA and SHEHAN was particularly commendable. It truly felt like being at home.
In my opinion, Central Restaurant offers the best buffet experience in Colombo. The combination of excellent service, delicious food, and a pleasant atmosphere makes it a standout choice.

The service in New Delhi was over the top, almost too much. Here it felt just right, extremely warm. The rooms are spacious, maybe or maybe not on par with the Taj, also a fine Colombo hotel. For me the important thing is in the people, of whom the Shangri La has so many good ones.

For example:

The restaurant manager, Udesh Buddhiki gave me personal attention every day at breakfast.  He was supported by good staff including Buddhini. 

The lobby greeters are a nice touch. I enjoyed talking with Hiyuni.

travelb2016,"We chose the Regal Reseau as a last minute change as we needed to be closer to the airport on our way out of Srilanka. And i honestly have no regrets with this choice!! Dates of stay were 26-28 April 2023.

We booked 2 rooms with city views, but were asisigned 1 City view room (1007) with a balcony that basically overlooked a blank wall. The other room had a partial sea view with no balcony (1003) , but views were obstructed by a tree. But the rooms were great. Beds were very comfy and rooms spacious and clean. ACs were cold as ever, a good respite after a whole day out in the heat. Shower cubicles were just the right size.

Lift was slow though between 8 floors! Breakfast couldve been better perhaps if more continental items were included.

The best part about the hotel was the rooftop infinity pool and views. The rooftop bar had a great menu too.

Menuka and Chinashi (I cannot remember his name from the front office) were excellent and ready to help. Menuka assisted with a later checkout for my parents at 2pm instead of 12pm. Much appreciated his kind gesture.

We would definitely return.","Lovely stay, comfy beds, great location to beach and airport",Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,-0.8904279411819157,0.4085732826900327

petesaund,"My initial attraction to this hotel was its modernity and rooftop terrace and infinity pool on sixth floor.It had eight rooms per floor over four floors so large enough to provide high standard facilities and amenities but not sacrificing intimacy.It is conveniently located on the on the outskirts of the tourist area which itself is jampacked with hotels and restaurants.Many of these hotels which we visited reassured us that we had made the right decision.
The room we had was a seaview deluxe with balcony.It was spacious with more than ample storage with all the amenities and facilities provided - in particular a fridge hairdryer safe and cable tv.
However the star attraction was roof top terrace with stunning view of the beach far up the coastline north and south and the ocean beyond.The terrace provided an eclectic tapas or small bites menu.Buddhika the manager here provided a convivial atmosphere with his professional engaging and helpful manner.
The breakfast room on the floor below delivered the same views with floor to ceiling glass.The breakfast provided many options of quality including fresh juice and a range of fresh fruits.The only disappointment here was the nescafe with no facility for expresso or filtered coffee.You would expect nescafe in a guest house or low rating hotel but not here.It is sometimes the little details which make a hotel standout - please provide proper napkins or serviettes rather than minscule paper thin ones.A special thanks also to Pradeep who manages the restaurant hands on and  very efficiently

More information on our stay:

We stayed at Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa in Negombo for one night in February 2023. We were a group of 3 couples (3 rooms). We arrived at 16:00h and even though check in would be at 14:00h one of our rooms was not ready at that time. We were told to wait another 20 or 30 minutes for the staff to finish cleaning.

Since the other 2 rooms were ready, we spent our waiting time in one of the other rooms. We realized immediately that the rooms were not properly cleaned. On the ceiling ventilator was a huge amount of dust that clearly showed, it has not been undusted in a long time. Also on other shelves etc (basically everything that was a little higher up) was a lot of dust.
The furniture was also already in quite a used condition.

Also did we book 3 double rooms with King bed and only one room actually was equipped with a king size bed. In the other 2 rooms they had just moved two single beds together as close as possible to make it look like a king size bed.

At 17:00h I went to the reception again to ask if it's finally ready and the staff member told us that it was ready. He guided me to our room and to our surprise they were still cleaning it.
While having housekeeping still in the room I pointed out all the dust etc. and they actually tried to clean it halfway afterwards.
So at around 17:15h we could finally go to our room.

After all that we asked for a discount on our rooms since (for Sri Lankan prices) they were not cheap at all. Our room had cost us 92 USD for one night.
After talking to the manager, the reception staff told us that we could go to the restaurant and have dinner for free (""you can choose whatever you want""). 

Arriving at the restaurant for dinner, we were being told that we can only go to the all inclusive buffet and not order à la carte.
I asked to speak to management and had to argue with them before they agreed on a discount on our rooms. They were very apologetic and I had a nice chat with the manager after all but I would have preferred to have a nice chat without having to argue before...

After all it was not a nice experience because it involved a lot of disappointment and argueing which I really don't wanna have to do on a vacation.
As I said already, the hotel actually has a lot of potential but they don't really live up to it.",Hotel with a lot of potential but not there yet. Not as luxurious as on the pictures.,Regal Reseau Hotel & Spa,-0.8904279411819157,-1.9385498306356874

JoeH799,"The One Ella is a gem. Ella itself is largely a ‘backpacker town’ - cheap eats, hostels/ home stays  etc. The One Ella is located roughly 10 minutes’ walk from the main street, right near the entrance to Little Adam’s Peak. For us this was perfect - away from the hustle and bustle. 

The property has two rooms, both with a lovely view of Ella’s Rock. The balconies are far enough away from the path so as to be disturbed by passers by and are separated by a privacy screen.  The room itself was simple, but had everything we needed - a comfy bed, mini-fridge, ample storage and a spacious bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean. The owner is a carpenter and has made many of the features, which is a nice, personal, touch. 

Breakfast was tasty. Coffee/ tea, fruit, fruit juice, toast and an omelette. Enough fuel for the (25 minute) walk to Little Adam’s peak (which I would recommend doing around sunrise) and the Nine Arches Bridge (also around 25 mins, although some of the terrain was a bit harder going). We also took a tuk tuk to the waterfalls, which was worth seeing. 

The owner, Dom, was great. Very friendly and accommodating. He went above and beyond in making arrangements for a 4am pick up for us to Udawalawe and even helped us with our luggage and sorted us a packed breakfast for the journey. He also recommend the Matey Hut and Adam’s Breeze for dinner, both of which were very tasty and extremely reasonable (c£6 for two, including soft drinks). 

At £50(ish) per night, it was slightly more expensive than most other properties in the town. But, you get what you pay for and the rate is inexpensive for what was a very pleasant stay.  If you are going to Ella, I would definitely recommend staying here.","Excellent location, would recommend",The One Ella,-1.002086142658085,0.4085732826900327

➕ WE LOVED ELLA and we LOVED The One Ella!!! We spent 4 glorious nights here as part of our honeymoon trip around Sri Lanka.There are 2 beautiful chalets overlooking the mountains which are very nicely designed and equipped with a hair dryer, kettle, air con, and a mosquito net. The owner Dimikas is incredibly welcoming and helpful, and Clint (who bought us breakfast/drinks) was an absolute gem, taking great pride and care in his work. They both speak brilliant English. The One Ella is located on the track up to Little Adams Peak which takes about 30 mins to walk up, and we would definitely recommend setting off at 5:30am to see in sunrise at the top (and beat the crowds).

Stonefox,"The location of the One Ella is perfect as it is away from the noise and bustle of the town but is only a 2-minute walk from the excellent Adams Breeze restaurant, provides absolutely fantastic views and is close to Little Adams Peak which is a must-do walk.
We were warmly welcomed by Dammika, the owner and our bags carried up to our chalet which was modern, clean and quiet. There are two chalets side by side with a single stairway leading to both. They both have terraces but are kept private by the thoughtful inclusion of a rolling privacy screen adjacent to each chalet. This allows you the joy of using the room and still being able to keep the curtains open and enjoy the fabulous view across the valley completely without fear of being overlooked.
The room is fitted with modern, stylish LED lighting, some discrete and others more normal in nature.  The room also has the benefit of air conditioning having been recently fitted. The bed is a modern four poster bed and is worthy of note. It was very large and by far the most comfortable bed we slept in during our stay in Sri Lanka. But for the fact that there is s much to see and do around Ella, we could have stayed in that bed for days.
Breakfast is brought to your terrace and consists of fruit juice, fresh fruit, Sri Lankan omelette, toast, preserves and tea/coffee.  One morning we leisurely ate breakfast whilst watching the tea pickers at work. It was a fascinating and memorable experience.  On another morning Dammika went above and beyond the call of duty by getting up to provide us with a take-away breakfast at 5.30 am when we had an early start. Dammika was so helpful and nothing was too much bother for him.

The two houses Dammika built are full of loving and stylish, with pleasant sources of indirect lighting. The breakfast with a beautiful view was excellent, definitely great value for money. He helped arrange a cooking class for us as well, which was a ton of fun, and gave us a tip on a short cut to the Arches Bridge. Finally, what we appreciated a lot was that he explicitly asked us for feedback on any room for improvement, which is a highly commendable attitude! :)",Our favourite place to stay in Sri Lanka!,The One Ella,-1.002086142658085,0.4085732826900327

The room was fantastic, big comfy bed, all very clean, good air con, wifi, tv in room but we didn't watch it. Beautiful views over the hills from the huge Windows. Only down point was the shower had very little pressure. Nice location out of the main loud tourist Main Street- about 200lkr tuk tuk ride away. Took us an hour to do little Adams peak from the hotel and it was a lovely walk. Lots of places to eat and drink in Ella- the rotti were great.

The service and the energy of the host was unbelievable, and on the higher level than most of the 5-star hotels we have been to. He built two cabins all by himself, with an attention for every detail. He helped us with food recommendations and all the arrangements like visiting the Demodara tea factory, transport (also negotiated good prices for tuk tuks) and helped us to get transfer to Udawalawa.

Their kindness and hospitality made me feel so special and my every need was anticipated and then taken care of perfectly. It was so striking because it was flawlessly executed everytime: non intrusive and 100% accurate.

Aletha87,"Please go here when you're visiting Ella. It is a rather new place. It is a bit out of the city center, but you can still easily walk there from the train station. Moreover, there are plenty of tuk tuks that can bring you to the place for a small amount of money. We actually liked the fact that it is not a super central place, because the city center is really touristic. The path to Little Adams Peak is right in front of this place. 

The room is amazing. Well designed, modern, clean, a great bed and a nice bathroom. The view from the house is breathtaking. The owner is really nice. He made us a delicious welcome drink and breakfast outside, in front of the house. He also played a bit of music to us (guitar and violin), which was beautiful.

katerhianrobinson,"Lovely accommodation. Food is absolutely amazing. Sadly our room was the closest to Ravana pool club and the construction of the 3 new buildings. They started work at 7am one day which was an early wake up call but it didn’t ruin our 2 night stay. I’d definitely pay extra next time for a room with a pool. The views from every room are amazing. We climbed little Adam’s peak which is so close to the resort. Room was great, view was epic, shower was lush. No complaints.

The staff all work so hard. The breakfast hoppers were unbelievable. The lunch snacks were fab too. The pool guys were brilliant. We got caught in a thunder and lightning storm by the pool and they organised umbrellas and a golf buggy for us. We gave them 500 LKR as a thank you. We also had a cake in our room, I think this was because it was our honeymoon. Was a lovely touch.

The only thing I’d say the hotel needs to do is change the entrance as at the moment tuk tuks and locals use it to go to Ravana pool club and little Adams peak. I think there should be 2 separate entrances.",Lovely 2 nights for honeymoon,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,0.4085732826900327

The views from the rooms  of little Adams Peak and Ella Rock were breathtaking. We could hear all types of birds and meditation OOMMM from afar. Very enchanting. we were thrilled with our stay.
we stayed one night in the honeymoon suite and in a deluxe the next. What was nice about the honeymoon suite was the bathtub WoW. we also loved the the mosquito net as there is no air conditioning and it was quite hot. We could sleep with the doors opened. The deluxe was also nice as it had a great view and the king bed could be rolled outside on the balcony. Very cool! No mosquito net but a ceiling fan helped with the heat a little.
We loved our meals. We took half board and we pleased with all of our meals that were authentic and fresh. Tasty food and nice staff. 
 We did spend an afternoon at the pool as we were too to tired to hike Little Adams peak. Why would we as we could see it from our balcony....we had very nice cocktails poolside

Usually although we prefer online booking, how it works in SL is info is more reliable over the phone, to which they weren’t very cooperative. Once we arrived at the hotel, they greeted us well, nice welcome tea, polite staff and the buggy ride to the room was great. The rooms were very subpar compared to other hotels at similar rates but the view from it was amazing. The food was average but having stayed for two days we felt like we were getting the same stuff again and again without much variety. The restaurant staff were friendly and kind but were not that professional (we could hear them chit chatting about other diners amongst themselves, whispering and laughing at their behaviour). It’s a nice place and theres a lot to do / see in the area but we felt like the stay wasn’t worth the price.

Otherwise our room was ok, new, a bit spartan and no aircon which meant leaving the doors open, which we like, but the room soon fills with mozzies. Our friends had the better (older)  room with the moving bed (better view than us) which they said needed some TLC.

Maureen_Vancouver,"We stayed one night at the 98 Acres (arriving late and checking out after breakfast) so our time was very short but the hotel is a lovely place to stay albeit pricey. Our room, 216, as probably all rooms, required a golf cart ride to get to as carrying luggage down the rocky hill is inconvenient and difficult. Give the cart driver a call 20 mins before you need a ride.  

We had a spacious and clean room with a king bed and a single bed. There was a seating area with coffee table, tv, a desk and large balcony. You'll need to keep the doors closed from evening on as the glass doors were covered with insects.  The view, especially at sunrise is beautiful.  The bathroom is very large and is all cement so be careful with wet floors. The shampoo, body wash, etc are in these refillable small ceramic jug shaped containers and a bit of a nuisance to use.  The hotel is eco friendly

It's very hard to get a room for 4 people. The hotel is popular so book well in advance. Our stay included a breakfast buffet at the on site restaurant which was wonderful and had lovely views.   The hotel grounds have a swimming pool and is steps from the Ravana Zip Line and Little Adams Peak.   

A lovely place to stay. Wish we could have spent more time exploring the grounds.  I was happy this hotel is located out of the main Ella town where it was full of partying crowds and very loud.",A popular place so book early,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,-0.7649882739728273
Ang01622,"The positives first - beautiful rooms! Lots of birds to be seen from the balcony, where you could also see Little Adam's Peak, which we walked up. Two of our group went on the zip line, which they said was amazing. The Nine Arch Bridge and Ella town were theoretically within walking distance,  but because of 1) the heat and 2)  the traffic, we took our transport.  Lots of restaurants in Ella  - we ate at Chill, which was good.
The negatives - the number of steps to get to the restaurant! Evening meal was so, so breakfast was buffet style and good. Lovely views from the outside seating area.  The pool was even further from our room than the restaurant,  so we didn't bother with it. The access road to the hotel and then to our rooms was awful! It seems that it is a shared public road, which they are addressing.

CambridgeJe,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was just idyllic. It was our favourite out of the six hotels we stayed in on our Sri Lanka trip last month. The view from our room was breathtaking - seeing the sun set and then rise over Little Adams Peak was amazing.  Laying in bed watching the fireflies out the window at night takes some beating too. The room itself (not one of the posh ones) was huge, clean and well equipped with a very spacious bathroom and a wonderful balcony.  

We found it incredibly peaceful sat on the balcony and although I've read some reviews complaining about construction work we didn't notice any noise/traffic at all. We also weren't bothered by the ravana resort, in fact we didn't even know it was there until my son and I took a walk up Little Adams Peak. 

We relied on the buggys to get around the resort as my husband has a lung condition and the drivers were always lovely and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes after phoning for one. Actually we found all of the staff very polite and helpful even though we only gave tips at the end of our stay. 

We enjoyed the breakfasts there (husband said it was one of the best hoppers) but didn't eat at the restaurant as, and this is my only tiny negative, there were quite a lot of steps which my husband struggled with. Instead we caught a short tuktuk ride into Ella for dinner both nights. If there isn't a tuktuk by reception you won't have to wait long, we then took the drivers number so we could call him for the return journey. 

The location is perfect for Little Adams Peak and a very short walk to Nine Arches Bridge, you could easily walk into Ella itself but personally I'd have been a little wary walking back in the dark with the crazy drivers so I'm glad we had to opt for the tuktuk. We liked the vibe in Ella town and then the relaxed tranquility of 98 Acres and we're already talking about going back and staying longer next time.",Heaven on earth,98 Acres Resort & Spa,1.0959948878766475,0.4085732826900327

In 2019 I visited as a local and had a good experience. But in 2024 I felt  discriminated against. My family checked in with the rest of our group and my daughter was told to put up her hair at lunch - which is fine, she has long hair- can get in the food-whatever. But the next morning at breakfast I realized that foreigners who had just as long hair as my daughter Weren’t told to put their hair up? Another thing we realized was that they complimented foreigners regularly (great!) but not once did they do so to Any local that was staying. Other complaints would be the foul smell coming from the bathroom and some shower and toilet bits were broken. I rated it 4 stars cause I really enjoyed it in 2019 but some things just felt off in 2024.","Great for foreigners, Discriminates against locals",Camelot Beach Hotel,0.001276017459939349,-0.7649882739728273

_X9109TL,"Отличный отель, но надо заранее быть готовым к нюансам. 
Отель не пляжный, хотя и располагается прямо на море. 
Не большой, камерный, без особых изысков. Стильная деревянная мебель, два бассейна - с пресной и морской водой. Лежаки есть. Полотенца выдают по запросу без проблем. 
Мы бронировали только завтраки. 
К завтракам вопросов нет. Голодными не останетесь. 
И яичница и блинчики и фрукты и ещё много всяких булочек-круассанов, - кстати, кофе на Шри-Ланке фу! Если вам важно - везите с собой. Чайник в номере есть. Молоко можно купить - в отеле есть чайник. 
Кофе на завтраке не понравилось. 
Платное тоже не вкусное. 
Номера нормальные. Матрасы-подушки удобные. 
Халаты есть. Зубные щётки, шампунь-бальзам есть. Даже бритва с гелем для бритья была. Фен так же есть. 
Есть сейф. 
Телевизор есть. Но он бесполезный. Российских каналов и музыкальных, например, нет. Ну и здорово. Он не нужен. 
Море… до пляжа Унаватуна першом 5-7 мин. 
По дороге к морю слева отличный ресторанчик Лемонграсс. 
Поверьте, много где обедали - здесь лучше всего. 
А манговый сок самый не дорогой на всём побережье. И ребята очень достойные. 

У отеля есть свой сервис на пляж - в отель их же сети, только на 1 линии - отвозит отельный багги бесплатно. Там же лежаки, и матрасы. Не забудьте взять полотенца из отеля. Обратно по той же схеме. 

Если будут вопросы - спрашивайте. Я обязательно отвечу.

LukOjle,"Мой отдых в отеле начался задолго до приезда - как я думала. Так как при выборе отеля и расположения, были важны несколько параметров, а именно - близость в пешеходной улице, но в тишине, небольшой отель стоящий в джунглях и обязательным условием был вид на океан! Пересмотрев все отели на побережье, мы выбрали Thaproban Pavilion Waves Unawatuna, а решающим фактором был номер под названием Wave Suit -  он есть на официальном сайте отеля, где с балкона открывается великолепный вид на скалы и океан. ЭТО было крайне важно! Почему, поймете чуть позже. Для того чтобы удостовериться, что тот номер, с видом на ОКЕАН есть и я не путаю его с другим номером я написала письмо представителю отеля - в ответе мне подтвердили, что все верно номер с фото который я прикрепила (будет ниже) - это Wave Suit 217! Получив письмо от менеджера, я отправила своему тур оператору информацию, что да действительно номер на фото, тот который мы хотим, правда не указав цифры 217 ( кто же знал, что именно это станет главным разочарованием). Но обо все по порядку. 
При обсуждении с агентом из компании AnyWay travel ( Минск), я четко и несколько раз указала на фото с сайта и еще уточнила, что в отзывах видела номер в видом на КРЫШУ с солнечными панелями и ни в коем случае не хочу такой номер, а вид должен быть на океан как в номере 217 ( номер в разговоре ни разу не уточняла, та как не думала, что в маленьком отеле и при той детальности выбора, могут возникнуть проблемы). Мне подтвердили бронирование Wave Suit и мы принялись ждать долгожданный отдых.....
День прибытия. У нас был свой трансфер от аэропорта и все было отлично, комфортный автомобиль, дорога заняла примерно 2 часа с остановкой для покупки сим - карты, так как в аэропорту была большая очередь. Все это время я ждала, как зайду в номер и увижу океан как на ладони.....
По прибытию нас встретил менеджер отеля Dumidu Roshantha 
 и буквально спустя минут 20 нас повели в номер...... Дальше, сложно описать мои эмоции, которые до сих пор не меня переполняют и к сожалению - они не положительные. Когда мы шли к номеру я поняла, что мы двигаемся не в том направлении, где я уже поняла по расположению здания был мой долгожданный номер в красивым видом. Открыв дверь, я сразу поняла что это не он , и пройдя на балкон  просто была шокирована ( это был номер 227). Передо мной открылся вид на КРЫШУ С СОЛНЕЧНЫМИ ПАНЕЛЯМИ за которым виднелся океан. Сказать что я была расстроена , ни сказать ничего! Я сразу спустилась вниз, и мы начали выяснять  как такое могла произойти. Почти два часа,  мы созванивались с представителями встречающей стороны, менеджеры пытались как урегулировать ситуацию, предложив другой номер ( понизив категорию, так как номер который мы хотели был занят…..), естественно на это мы не согласились. Выселять гостей из номера 217 - естественно тоже никто не стал.  Позже выяснилось, что номер 227 (с видом на крышу!) – так же является Suit , как и номер 217. Я была в шоке – в моем понимании не может номер высшей категории в отеле выходить на грязную крышу! Мой турагент, так же пропустила мимо тот факт, что я конкретно просила номер с видом на океан и повторюсь про номер с крышей ( не зная категорию) мы с ней так же говорили. По приезду турагента, нам предложили остаться в этом номере и попробовать найти другой отель…
Утром нам сообщили, что все отели подходящей категории заняты и у нас по сути нет другого выхода, как остаться в Pavillion. В качестве извинений, отель предложил на 5 ужинов, повысив питание с BB , до HB. Во всей этой ситуации хочу отметить действительно большое участие  MR. Dumidu Roshantha и его команды, которые пытались всячески успокоить и пытались найти выход. Вина безусловно была не их! А скорее неграмотного описания номеров Suit, а так же невнимательного отношения турагента AnyWay travel ( я считаю, что бронируя номер в маленьком отеле, можно было избежать такой ситуации, тем более фото и все остальные данные я предоставила, по сути сделав все чтобы максимально провести отпуск в красивом месте и красивым видом). ДО конца отпуска, чувство разочарования не покидало, ни меня ни мужа. Хотя в остальном отель отличный!
Шри-ланкийцы очень приятные и отзывчивые, вся команда знала о произошедшем и пытались максимально скрасить наше прибывание. Это было искренне! Отель оставляет приятные впечатления, все чисто и ухожено, вкусные, разнообразные завтраки – свежие фрукты и соки, блинчики и многое другое. Ужины там тоже понравились- выбор довольно таки большой – креветки, тунец, национальная еда, свежие овощи. Вопросов к уборке номеров так же нет – полотенца, постельное белье чистое и менялось каждый день, как и влажная уборка. Всегда оставляли чаевые трудолюбивым работникам.
MR. Dumidu Roshantha каждый день спрашивал как прошел наш день, все ли хорошо в номере и вообще за наше время проведенное в отеле , он проявлял максимальное внимание к нам, так же были сделаны небольшие памятные подарки от отеля. Отношением и сервисом – мы довольны на все 100 %. Да, отель не новый, но мы искали что-то атмосферное, небольшое, уютное и колоритом страны! 
Вывод: вернулась ли бы я в этот отель – да, в номер 227 (не смотря на размеры) – нет!
Приезжая на океан – ты хочешь видеть океан, особенно когда за это доплачиваешь.
Рекомендации отелю: я бы изменила категорию номера 227, размер номера не определяет его категорию, вид тоже очень важная составляющая!
Отдельное спасибо всему персоналу и MR. Dumidu (Dumidu Roshantha Property Manager
Thambapanni Lesure Hotels Unawatuna. )– вы старались сделать все, чтобы отдых прошел хорошо!
P.S. – когда идешь от отеля, в пешеходной улице (не к пляжу), слева, примерно на полдороги, семья продает напитки  ( стоит столик у входа в дом). Там двое мальчишек, одному около 8-9 лет, а второму 3 года… Он не ходит, врачебная ошибка из-за прививки как я поняла. Он сидит при входе слева на качалке – лошадке, рядом с аквариумной рыбкой. Если вам нужно будет что-то купить из напитков, загляните к ним. Местные жители живет не богато, а купив у них бутылочку колы или спрайта, вы поможете этой семье!",Похож ли на Wave suit? 227 номер.

Номера приличные, на уровне 3 или 4 -звездочных отелей, не хуже. 
Еда в ресторане неплохая, обычная. Единственное, готовят долговато, будьте к этому готовы.
Территория отеля совсем небольшая, буквально 300 метров в длину, особо не разгуляться.

1. The room with full glass windows overlooking the lush first valley ahead is too good. The rooms were very spacious and very clean. The balcony has priceless views!
2. The staff was very friendly and extremely polite. We intended to go early for our walk, so they arranged breakfast super early only for us. I remember the person saying “madam it’s your home, just let us know when do you want”. Thank you for your kind attention. Kudos to the staff! 
3. The bathroom has all amenities and again super large!

anderskingo,"Planters bungalow er et dejligt sted, med nogle fantastiske omgivelser og en fantastisk udsigt.
Vi var der 2 dage ifm. vires rundrejse i Sri Lanka.
Der er flere forskellige bungalows hvor den ældste er over 150 år gammel.
Vi var så heldige at få den der hed Lemon tree, som var en 1. Sals bungalow med en terrasse med fantastisk udsigt ud over bjergene.
Hvis man ønsker det kan man lade være at rulle gardinerne ned på de store glaspartier og blive vækket af solen står op.
Den lille have, fiskedam og de mange træer giver en autentisk skov oplevelse.
Personalet er rigtig flinke og imødekommende
Lille ulempe er det nærliggende tempel som starter med trommer og bede kl 5 hver morgen (og en time frem). Men man vender sig til det.

Sl840t,"Firstly, the positives - the balcony & view was amazing. The staff, mainly young boys were very polite. Breakfast was really good ( coconut roti was the best! ). 
This place could be amazing but unfortunately it’s not being looked after & is really dirty  - everything needs a deep clean.

 The bathroom in particular was really grotty with built up scum on shower walls & sinks.  This was not just few days or eve months of build up,I’d say years. The toilet was badly stained, which could be removed with some cream cleanser or bicarbonate of soda. Same with the sinks, the ceramic has no shine due to te build up of scum.  The cleaners seemed to have a spray but something more powerful is required.
 There was broken sunbeds lying outside our room - why not get rid of them. The look like they’ve been there forever. 
Given the price we paid £300 ( plus £25 bank charges as they insisted on deposit by bacs) for 2 nights, we expected at the very least a clean room. We raised our concerns with the manager when we left but the fact the room has been allowed to get this bad is beyond me. 

I’m sorry but cannot recommend this hotel.",Has potential to be amazing but very disappointing,Ella Planters Bungalow,-0.6905363357420602,-3.1121113872985475

The room was also very pretty and clean. The breakfast and dinner were delicious and the setting where you eat was so  quiet and peaceful. You could observe lots of animals in the trees.
We enjoyed the pool area and discovered the waterfalls in the area around the Hotel. One day we rented Scooters from the Hotel for about 15 dollars and drove to the Diyaluma waterfalls which was great fun.
The planters bungalow was the hotel with the best price/money ratio in our opinion and I can 100% recomment it!",Best hotel for a fair price,Ella Planters Bungalow,-0.6905363357420602,0.4085732826900327

Both food and service were excellent, and the manager - Jagath - more than helpful with advice and arrangements for making the most of my time there. Rooms are split between the original Planters Bungalow and 2 small newer blocks, each housing 4 rooms, built into the hillside. It was in one of these where I stayed, and the views were magnificent - most memorably the sights and sounds of nature during the early morning sunrise.

There were 5 local cows that wondered through the grass between the pool and the rooms but they were not a problem.

Food was also great. But the rooms can be a bit improved as the outdoor light on the balcony had to be repaired after informed by us and the toilet was leaking. We were there for our anniversary and it was pre-requested to put up a little decoration, which was not available when we arrived. But later when we came from dinner, it was done on our bed. So the staff had entered the room with no prior notice while we were away and it was not requested by me or my husband which seemed a bit of an invasion of our privacy.

However, what made this visit even more memorable and special was due to Chef Indunil’s great hospitality. He truly made our stay at Jetwing Yala special this year and also last year as well. He made sure that all our needs were attended to from offering the room with the best Sea view, to personalised snacks and meals to a nice small tour around the property.

georginab855,"We stayed here for 1 night as part of an 11 night tour of Sri Lanka. Our view of this hotel may be a bit tainted as the travel company had messed us around and changed the bookings as part of a scam to save money. They assured us this was much nicer than where we were supposed to stay (the Jetwing St. Andrews) as the Araliya Red is much newer. However, the price differential would argue otherwise. The reception is incredibly blingy with lots of gold statues and marble that makes it feel like a lot of money has been thrown around. However, the rest of the hotel is incredibly basic. The rooms are big but echoey and not very clean. Our shower was clogged with hair from previous occupants and flooded over the doorsill. The toiletries provided were very basic and anything else (slippers, dental kit, etc) came at a cost. Because of all of the hard floors, plain walls and thin wooden doors, the hotel is incredibly loud and I was woken up multiple times with noise in the corridor and room above. Despite the hotel advertising panoramic views of the city and hills, it seems that this view is only actually visible from the roof terrace (literally just a flat roof you can go and stand on). We had a view of the car park and the hotel is a soulless tower block with only one small garden court in the centre. The buffet food was awful and the service in the buffet was appalling, despite there being a lot of staff present.

Food options are kept topped up and never run out. Staff keep everything clean and remove used items from tables quickly. RUWAN looked after us particularly well at mealtimes providing service beyond our expections all through our stay. Thank you Ruwan! 
My only suggestion would be to keep the volume of the dinnertime music much lower. The high volume meant we couldn't chat. Even the restaurant manager couldn't hear us when we asked if the volume could be reduced.

PorgeHampshire,"This was the last stop on a busy 2-week Group Tour of Sri Lanka. It was our least favourite hotel. It looks tired in places. 
We had a spacious ground floor room with a small triangular shaped bathroom. The shower doors looked in need of a good clean. Our patio doors we discovered hadn't been locked properly so anyone could have pushed them open. In the early hours of the first morning we heard 2 distinctive taps on the patio doors which was unnerving. We didn't get up to investigate but whilst the hotel is behind gates and security at the front it seemed to me that there was nothing stopping anyone wandering in off the beach area.
This hotel is very popular with locals especially at weekends so when we arrived the hotel was packed with a large group of young men playing volleyball in the main pool. All sunbeds were taken by families sitting round chatting. As this was the only day of R & R part on our trip it was a bit concerning but by Sunday afternoon things had quietened down.
This is a very large busy hotel so breakfast was a bun fight and it took us 10-15 minutes to get served tea or coffee.
Nice outside seating area by one of the bars. 
As you are nearer Colombo you will get pestered on the beach to buy things.
The sea was too rough to swim in and there are dangerous rip tides.
There is nothing to do locally but we did visit the Victor Hasselblad Sea Turtle Research And Conservation Centre just 3 miles up the road. Well worth an hour's visit to see the wonderful work they are doing.  None of the multiple hotel staff hanging around reception had heard of it even though it is literally up the same road. But a taxi driver Googled it for us and took us there and back. 
The Hotel is off one busy road with shops and other Hotels but not in a specially pretty area. 
This area was impacted by the tsunami so you will see little graveyards and monuments in memory of people who lost their lives. Especially on the train that got swept off the track.",Popular and busy hotel with locals. A bit tired.,Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,-1.9385498306356874

SujirMurlidhar,"I had a quick 2 Nights stay at Heritance Ahungalla in October during my recent trip to Srilanka. This resort is in quiant  town of Ahungalla which is roughly 2 hrs drive from Colombo Airport. Though the entrance to the resort is  bang on main road, the rooms and overall facilities of the resort are tucked away in quite zone away from the main road. 

The resort has choice of rooms with Garden View, Pool View and Sea View. All the rooms have a sit out or balcony.  All other facilities needed for relaxing holiday like Restaurants, Gym, Games Centre, Swimming Pool, SPA is available at the resort. 

The rooms at the resort are of decent size with comfortable and functional bathroom. The upkeep of the rooms and overall resort, facilities are top notch. The staff at resort are welcoming and helpful to your requests. 

The resorts direct access to the beach is added bonus with the beach being quiet scheduled and more or less being private to In House Guests.

For Dining options the resort has their Main Restaurant which  offers Buffet & Al Carte options apart from  Pool Bar and Speciality Restaurants too. The Breakfast buffet is sumptuous with vide variety of food ranging from Local Srilankan  to international cusine. The Vegetarians options for breakfast  don't disappoint either with plenty of options from Local Srilankan, Indian & Continental Cuisine to choose from. The taste and quality of food served at breakfast is equally of high standard .

For Lunch or Dinner you can choose to go with Buffet or Al Carte. The prices for dishes in Al Carte is quite reasonable with decent choice for Vegetarians too. 

I had my dinner at their all day dining restaurant and surprisingly the Indian Chef dished out simple yet delicious Indian Fare. 

I would like to extend my appreciation for the Chef Mr.Balbeer Singh who was quite accommodative and helpful in suggesting the food choice considering we were vegetarian.  If you are craving for Indian Food at this resort then don't hesitate to reach out to Chef Balbeer Singh who will at your service with great suggestions. Thanks Chef for all your help and support during our stay at Heritance Ahungalla. Keep doing the good work.

From Excursion  or Sightseeing Point Heritance Ahungalla is reasonably placed from key sightseeing places like Galle, Bentota, Hikkaduwa etc; Most of these places are under 30-60 minutes drive from resort.

I throughly enjoyed my stay at Heritance Ahungalla and will definitely look forward to staying at Heritance Ahungalla the next time  I am in Srilanka.

Tucked away in the lush greenery of Ella, the resort is surrounded by dense forests, waterfalls, and the soothing sounds of the jungle. The journey to the resort, involving a scenic drive and a short off-road adventure, set the stage for the unique escape that followed.

The eco-friendly cabins were simple yet comfortable, designed to blend seamlessly with the natural environment. Waking up to the sound of birds and the rustle of leaves was a refreshing change from city life. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing the stay with guided nature walks and activities like waterfall abseiling.

marcinsL4130XP,"Well, no.   Big no. 
First of all, before booking, please go through all these comments. Look at the pictures. Not posted by the property but from guest. The place have a great potential but as of today it is just a scam. Place is undeveloped, rooms are nasty. Food terrible. All three above aspects can be fixed easily and reading that this ""in a jungle"" makes no sense. We travel to Sri Lanka often, staying in boutique hotels but also in a real jungle. All places can be clean and nice disputing the fact of not easy environment around. Same w/ food. Staying ""in a jungle"" explain nasty food served? Having so many option for low-key or upscale Sri Lanka' culinary possibilities? 

So we did claim many times issues on site. Zero interest. Management's reaction: it is what it is, deal with it. 
Immediate decision to leave. After one night in dirty room and without even touching a breakfast. 

Now it gets more interesting.. When I wanted to set a review on booking.com it turned that ... we have not stayed there. Ella Jungle Resort just canceled our stay, after the payment was taken. Now I understand the GM laugh on the phone and the answer ""good luck with the reviews, hahahah"". 

This is so fUp that such terribly managed places w/ the attitude as they have presented, in such beautiful country are making trips for tourists so unpleasant. I love Sri Lanka. We'll be back regardless. But I hope bs spots will despair from the accommodation map sooner than later.

Best thing is the staff they treats you like king and makes you feel very special. very friendly and always ready to do whatever you ask. no is something I didn't hear.

Amaya-FO3,"I am writing this with great frustration. 
Ella jungle resort gave us and everyone present the worst possible experience. 
First of all the location and the nature is very beautiful. I am sad to say it’s in wrong hands. On arrival the room condition was very bad. 
1. Toilet comods not cleaned 
2. Ant infestation everywhere 
3. No water supply 
4. Definitely no hot water 
5. No AC to all the rooms 
6. Towels wet 

Anyways we somehow managed and tried take a wash with the little water we got and go have dinner. 
At this point, we were super hungry following the tiring ride to the resort from the main road. 
But most of the items were over or almost over. Initially there was a few devilled chicken left. Once asked to restock it they brought devilled prawns and not chicken ( that also after a very long time) for a meat dish it was only the devilled prawns after that. For people with seafood allergy just eat the rice only?  because other dishes were also empty.  There was ice cream but no bowls to eat. 
Plates, cutleries, cups were not washed properly and there is no one at the buffet to check and restock the finishing plates, cutleries and food. No one nearby area to call also. Under the plates full of oil and noodle pieces on top of the plate  as they were not washed properly. 
We had to go to the buffet and keep on standing until we got something to eat. When we got something to eat we had to then stand waiting for plates. 

Since we had to experience this at the start we already made a complaint through whatsapp to the one who was taking the bookings. So that they will correct themselves and the next breakfast , lunch and the next day will be treated properly for the price we paid to get the so called 3 star hotel experience as mentioned by them. 
The reply I got from the operator was… “NOT allowed to have bites in buffet” 
So, i said yea no need to have bites in buffet if we can have dinner that’s enough. 
So the hotel team has informed her that some people are having bites from the buffet that is why this whole problem raised.
She never apologised or corrected the issue. 
Some other person not having bites is not the solution for all the problems I mentioned above. Even if they had bites, there is a limit a person can eat and for the money they took they are responsible enough to provide us with enough food specially when we were away from the main road. 
The full amount was already paid to confirm the booking. 
As all the guests couldn’t bear the frustration they tried to talk to the two so called managers called Isuru and Ajith. 
They too never apologised or tried to correct themselves. They are saying that the problem is this going under the name as hotel. This should be an adventure zone it seems. If this is an adventure zone, they cannot be charging such high prices and even if this is an adventure zone they cannot keep the guests starving like how we did for the dinner. Ajith is also saying that for one day become vegetarian and enjoy. If you expect the guests to eat vegetarian for the price they paid please add more vegetarian dishes without letting them eat only rice. 
Mr. Ajith’s behaviour is definitely not suitable for a manager over there. He doesn’t know how to behave. He is always trying to rule the guests and try to be the boss like an army commander over there. May be because the owner of the place is a commander? Under the term of hotel hospitality you cannot rule the guests and talk to them in rough tone and command them over things. The isuru the other manager is saying he will send all the staff home tomorrow because the issue to this problem is the innocent ground staff. 
From what I heard soon after an incident like this happens what they do is chase away the ground staff without even paying them their salary as if they are responsible for what happened. Yes the staff over there is not skilled enough for a three star resort. If you charge such amounts and advertise your business in such a way please also spend appropriately to give the best possible service, food and experience for the guests without being only profit oriented. Upon departure we had to wait for hours sleeping on the lobby until the cable car + jeep took us to the main road. They didn’t even let us stay on the room until their lorry is ready. On arrival we got a safari jeep but for departure we got a lorry. 
They do so much cost cutting here. 
They do not think about the time and value of it on guests. We had to leave with so much frustration and hunger. Soon after leaving the first thing we did was to go to the most nearest pol roti shop and eat. Where we got so tasty food and our stomaches got full. For everything I have mentioned I have evidence from screenshots, recordings and video clips. I hope they correct themselves because the nature over there is nice. 
But, I have also experienced similarly or even better more beautiful natural places for a lower budget and with great food and service. First of all the owner of this place should correct himself. I hope Ella Jungle Resort will soon correct themselves from cheating the guests. For everyone who is planning to go there, please think twice.",Frustrated,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-4.285672943961408

Pula94,"Disappointing Experience Despite Great Location

Our recent stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing, despite its fantastic location. The initial impression was positive, especially with the cable car experience, but everything went downhill once we entered our room.

Upon arrival, we found two used towels on the bed, which was quite unsettling. We requested fresh towels, but even then, there was no hot water available, making it impossible to enjoy a warm shower in the freezing cold. To add to our frustration, the room lacked basic amenities such as tissues—there was only an empty tissue box.

The cleanliness of the room was another major issue. The bed was covered in dirt and dead ants, forcing us to do our own housekeeping. This is simply unacceptable. To top it all off, dinner was terrible, making the entire experience even more regrettable.

It’s clear that the staff responsible for maintaining the property are not taking their duties seriously. This lack of responsibility and attention to detail left us with a negative impression of what could have been a great stay.",Disappointing Experience Despite Great Location,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-3.1121113872985475

beachl0ver247,"I believed in all the fancy things they boasted and posted on their Instagram and reserved this place for B&B on April 12th/13th days. In spite of the new year, they still accepted my booking at the same ongoing rate (50,000/= B&B).
During our journey we didn’t get single follow-up call from them to check whether we were safely on the way, that shows how less they care us. After reaching their Café at the bend Restaurant, we tried calling the resort contact Gayan to say that we have come, but he didn’t answer the phone ontime. So we went around the café to see if there is a security officer to inform that we have reached, but the Security Officer seated inside the café and he was deaf, his hearing was so bad and we had to speak too loud so that he would hear and understand what we say. And he wasn’t a presentable, attentive, supportive and vigilant security officer. 
This shows how negligent and careless they are about their security despite the fact the owner of the Resort being a retired Major in the SL ARMY. 
We had to wait for an hour for their Toyota Hi-lux truck to come and pick us to the resort. It was raining, and the truck’s condition was very bad, its roof was damaged and had holes. 
After we reached, we were given a welcome drink, since we personally had some health concern over certain food we consume, we inquired about the ingredients of the fruit drink. The waiter didn’t know what he served us nor did he want to ask the Chef. 
We were escorted to our room, and we came to know there was no hot water shower. Being  located in a cool climate area. So we had to have a shower in the freezing cold water. During the whole night there were power drops, we were in the dark many times, they didn’t have a generator. 
We order dinner from the a la carte menu in 3hrs in advance, but the food came only around 10pm. They gave an excuse saying they were short of staff due to sinhala  new year. But why do they undertake bookings then ? if they are unable to serve food or provide service on time ? 
When we woke up next morning, we realized there was no water in the tap.  We couldn’t use the toilet and we had no way of pooping or urinating.  The management didn’t know that the guests didn’t have water. We tried to call them, but their phone was switched off, so we had to come out of our room and walk all the way to the front reception area looking for a person to complain. So we disappointedly returned back to our room and walked down to the water stream near the resort (Kirindi Oya) and bathed and peed as well in the stream. Such a gross, unpleasant experience ever faced in life in my whole travel life. Then few hours later manager came and said tap is broken, no maintenance staff, they are getting water from the stream, som mud stuck in the T-joint blah blah. So we had to believe whatever he said. We were served a so called English type but very basic breakfast for the price we paid, two slices of toasted white bread, 4 tiny sausages , magarine and jam and omelet with spinach. No Coffee, No Tea, No fruit platter, No brown bread, no meat…They didn’t serve us water, but they had mineral water bottles, the glasses were full of ants. 
We finished our breakfast around 10am, and was going to check-out, Then we realized their cable car was not working due to some mechanical or electrical issue in the tractor engine they use to operate the cables. There was no mechanic to fix it, finally an old person called to be the Chairman of this resort came there 1hr later and he was trying all his skill to fix it. Fire sparks were coming out of the battery terminals and the engine of the cable car machine. Being a mechanic I was 100% sure it has not gone through regular maintenance of battery check-up. They didn’t even have a tool kit to diagnose the issue. While we were waiting for more than 1.5hrs, a retired major guy came tried to lame attempt to pacify us by giving a 150/= 2 FANTA bottles to pacify our frustration. But we rejected it saying we need to check-out ASAP. As were already wasted our money, time and energy which was worth more than 150rupees, and was very late for our next appointment while we were filled with anger and frustration.  
Cable car didn’t seem to be working, we were scared even if it starts working what would happen if  it suddenly stops in the middle in the air while on travel. So we decided to carry all our heavy bags o the shoulders walked on the shaky wooden bridge with great difficulty by balancing our body with fear of our lives and crossed stream to the other side of the land. The walk wasn’t difficult to get to the top, we lost our way, and it was the most terrible unpleasant experience we faced with carrying heavy bags in our shoulders. We had no assurance that there would be a lorry waiting to take us back to the road as the Toyota Hilux what they use had gone to wellawaya town for some other work. So the resort people had to bring a lorry from outside to take us back to the road where our vehicles were parked near the ”Café at the Bend”.. 

MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,  PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS PLACE.

kateandjanaka,"We stayed here in early September. 

Positives:
- Thoroughly enjoyed the waterfall trek where we could jump into the waterfall and swim. The water was clean and the two ex-navy guides who came with us were very friendly and helpful. When I got stung by 2 wasps they were quick to clean my stings with antiseptic and provide some topical medicine. Obviously have a lot of knowledge about the jungle. 
- Surrounded by beautiful nature, in the evenings you can sit and read a book, while listening and watching the wild peacocks, cows grazing, duck waddling and other animals. 
- All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The young man who served us food was very polite and always trying to do his best. Also, we asked about improving the water pressure in our shower along with getting a fan for our room, and this was provided within the hour we asked. 
- Staff helped us book our bus ticket to Colombo. 
- Organised a bonfire for us in the evening which was very nice.

Negatives:
- The room. While the room initially looks aesthetic and in pictures looks beautiful, the actual practicality of the room is lacking. The top half of the room was totally open and you couldn't lock the glass doors on the balcony. Unfortunately this led to an extremely poor night sleep. We appreciate we are in the jungle, however the fear of monkeys, bats or anything else being able to enter our room easily was disconcerting especially with all the noises you can hear in the night. In addition, theres very little security in the resort so while it might be dramatic to say, with lack of service on the mobile, it can be a bit worrying to be sleeping with a glass door open to anyone who could enter. 
- Food was average - it was nice and personally I liked the vegetarian aspect as I eat a plant based diet. However, my partner did get a bad stomach after breakfast. 
- Not sure what bug, but woke up with many bites on my body, not mosquito but some kind of midge. So would be nice to have a mosquito plug. 
- No receptionist on arrival, she was only there on check-out which we felt was slightly unprofessional. 
- Also we asked if we needed to bring water bottles to which they told us they would provide water bottles. However, on check out we were charged around Rs. 1400 including tax for the water bottles we consumed. We literally would have brought our own had we known this.  
- Curtains had many holes in maybe from moths or rats. 

Overall, the staff really carried our stay and without them we would have left before the night. Higher management of the actual property needs to be dealt with, i.e. renovating the rooms. In addition, not worth the money you pay. It was the same price for us to stay here as cinnamon lodge hotel in habarana which is a 5 star hotel (with facilities such as buffet, swimming pool, in room dining, bicycles etc), and this resort does not live up to that standard.",Great staff but lacking higher management and not worth the money :(,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-3.1121113872985475

AmandaShafer,"Let me start with the one negative - the drive down to this place is not easy! You have to take an off road vehicle and it’s about 4km of windey, bumpy travel. We were seriously questioning our choice in hotel … then we got to the bottom and had to take a gondola across the forest/river and all our doubts vanished! As we got down from the gondola we were greeted by the amazing view of a rice field, with peacocks wandering around. Behind the rice field was towering trees. Our rooms were next to a bumbling stream, beautiful and so picturesque picturesque. The food we ate was all grown in the 280 acres. It’s 100% self sustainable. They grow all their rice and vegetables. They are 100% organic and make their own worm compost. As an avid Gardner I was fascinated and delighted to walk around the fields and observe all the fruit and vegetables.

There is no Wi-Fi in the cabins, it was the perfect opportunity to just relax and unwind. We had dinner under the stars with a roaring bonfire. This place has so much to offer. The staff was very attentive and kind. If you are a bird watcher, lots of birds to see.

Once you go in there, it takes time to come and go out. So before you go there, plan your trips to other places in Ella accordingly.

Linuka232,"We led on a journey with an adventurous off-road drive into the Ella jungle and a rare cable car experience in Sri Lanka. The hotel and rooms are located in riverside and jungle environments. 

The food and beverages are organic, and most of them are vegetarian. Organic meals are delicious and ideal. They maintain large organic cultivation and a poultry farm to fulfill their vegetables etc supplies. There is an indigenous herbs cultivation that is done with the hope of renovating Ayurvedic medication. As they mentioned they wish to start an Ayurvedic medication center as their next project.

It was observed that some services were unable to be fulfilled because of side effects of Covid19 and the prevailing economic crisis, but we give a big tribute to staff continuing the resort at that level.

We had a great set of experiences that could not be taken from any other place.

Highly recommend it for nature lovers, adventurers, and calm seekers. I hope the resort will reestablish to a level which it was before COVID19.",An unforgettable adventure time in the Ella wild,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,0.4085732826900327

The views are spectacular and the cries of peacocks fill the air. The enchanting and extensive grounds are full of gorgeous trees and flowers, and further down, the herb, spice and vegetable gardens provide ingredients for the freshly cooked meals. At night, we would sit over dinner watching the fireflies dance through the trees. The staff were friendly and helpful. It is difficult to tear yourself away from the beauty of the place but we found some interesting, off the beaten track, places to visit - notably, Buduruwagala rock carvings, boasting the second largest Buddha carving in Sri Lanka - and where you can also take a peaceful boat trip across the lake, with its varied bird life. I would definitely recommend popping into Sam’s Cafe - a lovely little cafe on the river, with a charismatic manager who made us refreshing milkshakes and arranged the boat trip for us.

R6954GOisabellas,"We recently stayed at Ella Planters Bungalow and was overall very satisfied with my experience. We was pleasantly surprised with the upgrade we received upon arrival, and the staff was incredibly sweet and helpful throughout our stay.

However, one downside was the bed in our room. It was quite creaky and made noise every time we moved, which made for a somewhat restless night's sleep. Additionally, the air conditioning unit was positioned directly above the bed and emitted a bright light that was somewhat distracting, so we had to resort to wearing sleep masks to block it out.

Despite these minor issues, we would still highly recommend staying at Ella Planters Bungalow. The property is stunning, and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible.

ssG6799GA,"We stayed at The Courtyard Colombo in August with our two children and had a great experience. Customer service and room cleanliness is high priority for us and this hotel was nothing short of excellent in those aspects and more. Breaking down the specifics in case it helps.

Location: 
*Approx. 45min drive from the airport.
*Conveniently located close to key touristic sites in Colombo.
*The hotel connects to the Colombo City Center mall which has a range of stores including grocery, apparel, a food court and activities for kids. 

Service:
*Customer service is impeccable at all levels. Special thanks to Vimal at the front desk who was very professional and welcoming even at the crack of dawn. 
*The staff at the Beira Kitchen (restaurant at the hotel) especially during breakfast were very warm, welcoming and extremely helpful. Special thanks to Jehan at the restaurant  for his great service and help!
* Room service at this hotel is great and comes relatively fast despite the time of day. 

Room: 
*It appears that the hotel is quite new. The King Suite was spacious, clean and things were in excellent condition. The balcony ares was quite spacious and sea view was perfect. The outdoor seating upholstery could use a face lift/dust-off though. The spacious walk-in closest was a definite plus!

Food:
*The breakfast buffet and Sri lankan food at the Beira Kitchen was scrumptious. The breakfast buffet was an additional cost, but worth it for the convenience and spread offered. Had plenty of options even for young kids. 
*The cafe right at the entrance of the hotel was also good. They offer a variety of sweet and savory pastries, cakes, coffee, juices etc. which
 was perfect for a quick grab-n-go.

We were told about this place by the our guide Nalaka. At the time, we thought the price was much more expensive than other places we have found… but based on his reviews and the others we read, we took the chance. After this experience I can say it was worth every single thing penny and more. This is jungle paradise.

PorgeHampshire,"We stayed 2 nights in October 2024. The Hotel exceeded my expectations. We stayed in a Jungle Chalet which was palatial and beautifully appointed. With a large veranda with beautiful teak seats. 
The staff advise you not to walk to and from the main buildings on your own after dark but it isn't concerning and the walk is short. I think it is as much to avoid animals but also prevent falls on the slightly uneven paths which have low lighting for environmental purposes.
The communal areas in the Hotel dining room and rooftop bar are lovely. The food is plentiful and excellent. The pool is large and very relaxing. Behind the pool is a large lake/lagoon in which water buffalo, crocodiles, storks, birds, can be seen. It's not safe to walk round the lake for this reason. But it is very atmospheric and interesting to watch the animals. 
To access the Hotel you pass through a Security checkpoint at the entry to a dirt road. This road takes tourists to the Relais et Chateaux, Hilton, Cinnamon Yala. Possibly also the Jetwing Yala.
You can see the roof tops of the Hilton and Jetwing from Cinnamon Yala. Sadly the Hilton seems to be designed in a brutalist style of architecture out of keeping with the environment.
The section of Yala National Park accessed from the Hotel is busy and there can be up to 8-10 jeeps queueing to see a leopard sleeping in the trees. But the half day we spent in the park was interesting. 
Unless you plan to do 2 jeep drives (not necessary) then 2 nights stay is ample. There are no 'entertainment' facilities at the Hotel e.g. a gymn/spa and the hotel is not near a village or other facilities. So once you are there, you are there!",Modern and spacious hotel in the Yala National Park buffer zone,Cinnamon Wild Yala,1.862766593118593,0.4085732826900327

DCOC,We stayed for 2 nights while we did some safaris nearby - the room was big enough for the three of us and very comfortable with a balcony looking out at the pool and sea.  The pool is amazing - so long!  Unfortunately we were not able to swim in the sea due to very rough conditions but there is a lifeguard on duty just in case anyone was tempted.  I had a good chat with the very friendly lifegauard who I think must have been really bored given the conditions.  We had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant - great choice available and the food was very good.  The first morning we got a takeaway breakfast as we left the hotel at 5:30 and it was also very good.  The hotel is built in an open style and when it rains heavily the floors can become very slippy but the staff do their utmost to keep it safe.

- Change the hair conditioner in your washroom. It’s not effective. My wife had to use 3 bottles and yet she was not satisfied. 

- The culinary staff and the servers need to be trained on safe food handling and how to react to dietary needs of the guest.

P2220BJjamess,"Few staff could speak English- in a 5 star hotel this is surprising compared to all other places in Sri Lanka we stayed in. Because of this our check-in was confusing - the poor girl really needed someone with her with better knowledge of the hotel and room and could speak reasonable English
Not well trained- so many gaps in knowledge.
I think the team has not been well trained in customer service- 
Dinner was very poor- most of the buffet stations were not ready when opened and had to wait a long time- eg 1 hour after opening to access.
Average quality food
Our drinks at the bar were forgotten too at the bar- 3 of us got them and another was completely forgotten- no apology either.
Just a very average stay- our worst in 2 trips to Sri Lanka- given what we had heard about Jetwing this was a surprise and we won't stay with any Jetwing again given their low standards

On top of that the dishes were covered with plastic covers that need to be lifted but no place to put it on. It was a complete failure in terms of food presentation (poor standards). One of the staff was rude when I questioned about the Safari prices. However, Nayomi who looked after us was excellent. Very kind and acted upon every request we made and she ensured we felt happy.

LivvyS6,"Luxury in the jungle. Amazing place, so much to do and see on this resort - including waterfalls to swim in, walk around the crops and meet the farmers, yoga, sit round the firepit, and more. The road is incredibly bumpy down and then there is a cable car to the resort - all very exciting and very out of the way from anything (thus making it tricky to leave easily or when you want). I spent one of my afternoons swimming in the waterfall with the Chef and then walking round the crops with him picking fresh fruit and veg to try and discuss what to have for dinner. Big shout out to the chef, Wassan, who made this experience for me. Super lovely and super funny, and his food is outstanding.

Destination76237,"What a beautiful setting in a deep jungle. It is  only a short ride of 4x4 and cable car away from the road and yet you are world away. The chalet we stayed was amazing. It was huge and very tasteful like a decor in a movie. Our huge balcony/deck  sat  over the steam which you sleep with its soothing sound.  We were looking right at the jungle. Actually we were in jungle. All day we watched monkeys, birds, eagles and all sorts of wild life by sitting on our deck. 

But what is more important than its magnificent setting was their staff. We have never come across such unspoiled, friendly group of people before. Despite it is a professional establishment they treated us as if we were their family. We literally exchanged hugs and numbers when leaving. The food was  local organic vegetarian and amazing. The  ingredients  picked from Ella Jungle Resort’s own  farms. The Chef Wasante  who was also our favorite guy was  not only an amazing chef but also an amazing PR guy who made our stay memorable. Our guide Abi was very knowledgeable and sweet. He gave us free jungle tours to amazing waterfalls nearby. Manager Rowan was very helpful and friendly.  Literally we have experienced true Sri Lankan hospitality there, which is priceless.

Overall,  everyone should go there not for an amazing  jungle but also  for true Sri Lankan human experience.  We will definitely go back there  at least to see our dear  friends in the jungle.",What a combination of  beautiful Jungle setting and true Sri Lankan hospitality,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,0.4085732826900327

teedemel,"This was my second visit to Ella Jungle resort and I was disappointed to find that the standard of the property has deteriorated.

COVID Guidelines
We were really surprised to find that the property did not follow proper COVID safety guidelines. There were no temperature checks done, there was no hand sanitizer offered, and no social distancing maintained at the buffet. Food was served buffet-style with unmasked guests serving from the same spoons/cutlery - this made us really uncomfortable, as on one of the days the resort was operating at full capacity. The safety of guests must be prioritised in such situations. 

Food

While the food wasn't terrible, it does not deserve special mention. The choices of food served were always very random. On one night we were served macaroni and cheese, accompanied with a potato curry coleslaw. The combinations of the side dishes and mains could use some thought. 

Service
The service at the property was fine. Although we did notice that they were severely understaffed. Suresh, the manager, was compliant with all our requests. Our waiter, Kumara, was also polite and friendly. 

Environmental Impact
We were surprised to find that the property offered plastic water bottles in each room, which did not fit with their ethos of being 'eco-friendly'. This is something the upper management should seriously consider: either switch to glass bottles or offer filtered water for guests. It is simply not acceptable to consume so many single-use plastic bottles.

Maintenance
The wooden walkway to our cottage had loose boards and sections missing. This could potentially be a hazard, especially for small children. On our first night, there was also no running water in our bathroom. The property did offer to change our rooms, but we chose not to considering it was nearly 10pm in the night. We were informed that this issue had happened before, which makes us wonder why it was overlooked the first time?

Overall, we feel this property has great potential. The location is beautiful, the surrounding river and waterfalls are stunning. Although there were no proper designated trails or paths, there is also potential to promote this as a destination for birdwatchers. We sighted the rare and endemic Racket-tail drongo and other unique species like the Indian Pitta and Tickell's Blue Flycatcher.

We sincerely hope the upper management does look into these factors. In my opinion, at the current price, the experience at Ella Jungle Resort is simply not worth it.",Read this before you visit  Ella Jungle resort.,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-1.9385498306356874

The HIke is the best activity in this hotel. we got a nice guide on our hike. wear shoes on this hike unless you will be attacked by Leeches. the hike is about 3km. In this hike, there is one place to climb a rock with help of a rope.

shameemam2022,"Our much awaited staycation at Ella Jungle Resort was super fun and adventurous. From a half an hour 4-wheel bumpy ride into the forest to a cable car ride to get to the resort, it was quite an experience. The views around including a flowing stream amidst the greenery were a cooling sight and ideal for relaxation. Not to forget the natural sounds of birds and water flowing! The in house activities included ziplining which was quite daring and waterfall trekking.
The service provided is commendable. The meals were all made from organic produce sourced from their garden.Each time the meal was served in different  places with beautiful  unique scenery around  to admire.
The camp fire was lit to give warmth to the cold breeze when the dinner was served in open air
 My two kids enjoyed the beauty of vegetables grown around , the sight of peacocks and other beautiful birds around.
The rooms were super spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful too.

Nirm2590,"Would not recommend this hotel to anyone as a Sri Lankan. Thankfully only stayed for one night.
The hotel is a very large concrete structure and looks like a lot of money was thrown around but the decor is old fashioned, tasteless and ugly. The reception staff  are more like patrolling security guards and not welcoming. We were asked by at least 03 people with false smiles if we had a reservation. The lobby was cold, draughty and smelly.
The room was very large and had beautiful views but was EXTREMELY COLD. The floor was like ice. There was a heater but it didn’t work properly or maybe the room was too large for it, we spent the entire night wrapped in scarves and wearing slippers cos it was so cold.( no bathrobes or bathroom slippers are provided btw, normally I don’t use or expect them but this hotel needs them cos it is soo cold ) Cleanliness was ok. You will get sugar and only two bags of tea provided in the room.all others including coffee and milk have to be purchased(first time seeing this in a long time.)
Buffet spread is large with many choices but i found only one item that was tasty. Other food was tasteless. No cheese is provided even for omelets. Good thing is that tea,  coffee and  milk station is provided for both breakfast and dinner. The serving staff were good and polite but the female chefs were curt and disinterested. The pasta station in particular was HORRIBLE.
There is a heated pool and pool area is clean and big. The pool bar served tasty food.

I guess this hotel is adequate if u were staying for a conference but please do not choose for a vacation. If you are looking for the old world charm of Nuwaraeliya with chintz, warmth and comfy sofas you will be extremely disappointed. I couldn’t wait to leave. For a similar price or a bit more there are much more better hotels in Nuwara Eliya, except maybe u wouldn’t get a buffet spread.",Worst 4 star hotel experience in recent memory,Araliya Red,-0.2837256856086045,-3.1121113872985475

amit944,"It was one of the worst experience staying in a 4 star property. Starting with staff - cold, unresponsive and they do feel that if by allowing you to enter their hotel they have done a big favor to you. Rooms - ordinary. I paid equivalent of 35000 LKR for a triple room, but these rooms are not worth even 10000 LKR. Toiletries are chargeable despite my hotel confirmation voucher saying it's included in fare. Restaurant and Bar - Inexperienced staff. At breakfast everything is self service which is fine. But just 2 attendants to manage 200 PPL seating area is just bad. Now the worst part, at 6.30 am in the morning something like fire alarm 🚨 went off for good 20 mins in the rooms across the hotel. Waking everyone up. Staff shrugged it off saying technical issue which is normal for them. C'mon guys - 25 years of traveling in my life, never seen something like this.

SSJ420,"This place calls itself 4 star budget. It should just be budget with 4 star prices. The only plus point about it was that the rooms were spacious.
Thereafter it went downhill and I only have negative experiences to report.
Asked for a second key for the rooms. Initially agreed. Then refused. Threatened with a poor review and the keys were given.
The complimentary items in the room left much to be desired. Tea bags but no creamers! Had to pay for creamers! 
Bathroom had one tiny soap.
Furniture in the room had water stains.
Reception staff untrained in knowledge and customer service. Was told al la carte available but it wasn’t. Could only get room service by scanning a qr code. Reception did not know this.
When checking out everyone got passed between 2 reception staff. Why do you need two people to check one person out?
Buffet breakfast had staff floating around. Asked for sugar and was told where to go and get it with no offer of bringing it!
Nescafé free but all other coffee to be paid for! 
I think management are also to blame as staff had no discretion and things like charges for creamers was a management decision.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating from the moment we arrived, and they went above and beyond to make us feel valued during our visit.

With a private balcony facing the ocean, our accommodation was airy, contemporary, and spotlessly clean, making it the ideal place to watch the sunset. The cuisine was yet another highlight; there was an amazing array of delicacies from around the world and locally, at the buffet. The most romantic part of our trip was the candlelit dinner by the ocean.

The infinity pool was also a hit with us; it was like being in a tropical paradise. The grounds were nicely manicured, and we relished quiet",A Perfect Romantic Getaway!,Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,0.4085732826900327

Food (as buffet menu) was fantastic, staff were very helpful. Any little issues we’re dealt with professionally and quickly.
We would like to thank all the staff we had contact with. Special thanks go to Ms Jayaru in Customer Relations, Chaminda in housekeeping, Ms Hasini and Duminda (who remembered us from 2022) in the main restaurant. They were able to reserve a table by the window we liked.

The rooms were clean and had a good bathroom. One of the best hotels in Sri lanka which provides great safety. but didn't have a nice view.

If you are a sea food lover, you must visit this hotel. Crab, prawn, cuttlefish and many more seafood things in one place. Never experienced such a thing before. They had a good buffet with a lot of varieties and they served tasty foods. But only a few items were delicious. I experienced that drawback from this kind of bigger buffets serving hotels.

Departure48775191886,"I recently stayed at Heritance Ahungalla and it was a impressive and comfortable stay! The staff were friendly and welcoming. 
The hotel is designed by Deshamanya Jeoffery Bawa and is wonderful in all sense. The vastness and aesthetics of the property, the breathtaking views of the pool, beach and the surroundings from the moment you enter the hotel. It is definitely an experience. The salt in the air singes your nose in the best way possible. They have tried to upkeep the original architecture of the building from the 1980's as much as possible and it is pleasant on the eyes. 

The breakfast buffet was decent and had south Indian options. The breakfast buffet had alot of options and varieties, however, the taste of the food did slightly fall behind for the price paid and for what was expected. This also applies to their Dinner buffet. On the other hand, the room service menu though very limited has tasty and reasonably priced options (special mention to the nasi goreng, which was delicious with a good portion size).

A special note on the very wonderful welcome we recieved at the property. The cold towel and the welcome drink was refreshing and the staff are very very polite and willing to help you with anything. 

Me and my wife, we stayed in the 'luxury room' category of rooms. The room was pleasant and spacious with 'L' shaped balcony access. The views from the balcony did not bore us throughout our stay, breathtaking every single time. We just stayed at the property and enjoyed the property itself. However, travelling to nearby locations such an Lunuganga, Bentota river sports, etc should not be an issue at all, as the property is very accessible by uber/pickme. 

However, despite the food being okay, it's better to opt for full board or atleast half board as there are not many options for restaurants nearby.

I highly recommend the hotel to anyone seeking to have a relaxing vacation on the beach while enjoying a piece of Bawa architecture.

The hospitality and friendliness of the staff was evident from the moment we stepped in to the lobby.
our room on the 3rd floor overlooking the Indian  ocean was spectacular. the room was very spacious and comfortable. The balcony outside the room afforded us time to read and relax in the evening.the bathroom was very clean and had ample counter space to keep our toiletries.
I must make special mention of the unbelievable spread at each if the buffet meals. We arrived just in time for the lunch buffet Starting with soup to salads to Srilankan Indian Chinese and western dishes the spread was enormous. The dessert menu too was too numerous to
mention. The  dinner and breakfast menus were excellent with the gourmet spread to cover every pallet needs.
We must  make special mention of Mr. Pradeep Guneratne the FnB Executive who ensured our stay was memorable, Being a long weekend in Srilanka the hotel
was at its capacity. Pradeep and his staff ensured that the guests were seated with the minimum wait times. Pradeep surprised us with a special dish of Srilankan crab curry Coconut sambol and roast bread which truly was a delicacy we had not had in years.

Leider ist es in dem Hotel nicht üblich, draußen auf einer Terrasse zu sitzen zu den Mahlzeiten. Nach freundlicher Anfrage beim Personal wurde uns dies aber ermöglicht! Wir (ich hatte ein Ehepaar kennen gelernt) hatten jeden Morgen und jeden Abend einen Tisch draußen.

FriederikeB774,"We fell a little bit in love with this place and ended up staying 4 rather than just 2 nights. Was it the comfy beds with the magnificent view across paddy fields and into the Ella gap? Or the monkeys and the giant squirrel and the brown-headed barbet that joined us for the delicious breakfasts each morning?
The staff make this place a cut above the rest- always smiling, always helpful; it included a guided tour of the magnificent property and garden. The chef came out every night to greet us-his food was simply scrumptious (jackfruit curry, pancakes for breakfast, crispy fried bacon and fresh fruit juices), wow.
But it was the little touches that made Planters so special-the fresh flowers at the foot of the Buddha, a sense of pride and endless kindness.
If you need a break-this is a good place to take it-the garden is full of beautiful flowers and birds; there are plenty of places to relax in the shade and by the pool and you can walk into the hills along the little country road behind the hotel.

The location is very beautiful and from the individual bungalows you have a fantastic sunrise with a view of the rice fields and agricultural areas far below. The pool is large with beautiful sun loungers. The garden area with banana plants and large jungle trees is beautiful and very well maintained. There is also a smaller agricultural area. The rooms and the bathroom are large but sparsely furnished. As in almost all hotels, drinking bottles are provided for room service every day. The location of Ella Centrum is about 8-10 km away (to the south). So you need a shuttle service. This is offered by the hotel for a fee. The breakfast outside in the garden is very good and rich.

I’d like to express my gratitude to the Resort Manager Lashanthan for being so welcoming. The staff at the reception were very efficient. Thank you to Sandu and Thilina who were so friendly and always interacted with the guests with a smile.
The team from Cinnamon Nature Trails—Kasun, Sampath, Sudath, Gayan—was outstanding. They were so kind and their love towards nature and wildlife was evident. We went on a nature walk to a breathtaking sand dune with Sudath, where we saw elephant footprints on the beach, a first for me! The walk and safari they organised became the highlight of the trip, with sightings of wildlife and magical views of the evening sky.
Dining was also a delight, thanks to Sahan and his team, who provided excellent service. Chef Manjula and his team served up exceptional meals, with the Sri Lankan buffet deserving special recognition. Ananda’s creative cocktails added to the overall experience.
Additionally, I appreciated how seriously the resort takes the security of its guests, which made us feel safe throughout.

niall1066,"Jetwing Yala is a quality hotel with high grade fixtures and fittings, some of the best beds and pillows we have experienced in any 5*, wonderful food, and service that gives some of the premium brand names a run for their money. 

It’s certainly not perfect-we arrived to a ceiling being taken apart with a hammer drill (Jetwing should be notifying clients in advance) which carried on through the afternoon. And the pool, whilst outstanding in terms of size, cleanliness and the swim up bar, needs maintenance to repair numerous missing tiles. The decision not to use cushions on sun loungers is odd and not in keeping with 5* hotels. 

But you look past all of that because it’s just a damned nice place to be. The front of house manager was always present and addressed our concerns immediately. His entire team are a credit to him and the Jetwing brand. 

And the beach-okay you can’t go swimming in monsoon season but there’s nothing stopping you sitting and watching one of the most beautiful views in the region. 

We would highly recommend this hotel. And if they do renovate the place it would be epic. 

Thank you for a wonderful couple of days!",Good quality hotel,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,-0.7649882739728273
MartijndD1971,"The place is, we are sorry to report, a total scam given the prices charged. The fotos on the jetwing yala website (of rooms, bathrooms in rooms, pool and facilities) do not match reality. At all! 

In fact, by asking staff we discovered that everything was staged 9 years ago after which they removed all the little elements that provide comfort. Mattresses on the loungers at the pool? Gone. Cushions on the balcony furniture? Gone. 
 
The place has not been maintained properly with the roof falling apart and doors not closing. The block out curtains were dirty and broken and ineffective. The doors to the balcony were broken (we changed rooms twice, same result). The bathroom has an open air connection (not advertised on the website!) so insects are everywhere plus it is steaming hot. The aircon was making huge noise but barely kept the room at a decent temperature. Bed has a plastic protection cover (?!?!) that makes you sweat. Open electricity cables everywhere. See picture. 

And that for the incredible price of the equivalent of eur 385 per night (halfboard). Per room. 

Pool area very poor with broken tiles, tired furniture and a shallow and hot pool. Guy at poolbar very friendly. Beach area worthless. Some poor fellow is guarding furniture that was deposited there 9 years ago after which nothing was done. They mention a bar is there too but I think the dunes swallowed it.  

Food quality (we did lunch and dinner a la carte after cancelling halfboard) good and reasonably priced. Good service. 

We were offered (by the gentle front office) a bottle of wine with a value of eur 30 as compensation which was a nice gesture but grossly insufficient. 

We asked by email prior to booking
1/ have you solved the insect issue. Yes. Lie 1
2/ do you have large groups. No. Lie 2
3/ do you have ongoing construction. No. Lie 3
They are working on the roof and several blocks are being refurbished. 

Shame on you Jetwing management!

PS the location is close to the yala block 1 entrance but make sure your safari company buys the online premium ticket. that gives you priority access. We were stuck as jeep #50 in a long queue eliminating the advantage of being close by

The outdoor bathroom is unique and fun, particularly if it rains and you get the chance of a shower in the shower. 
The pool is huge and in the afternoon quite often has a visit from the local family of monkeys who like to come down and get a drink.  The sea was too rough in this area to swim in so the pool was our base in the afternoon.
The food was great and had plenty of choice. The hotel also packed us a 'soft breakfast' of pastries and fruit to get us through an early morning safari until we returned for the proper buffet breakfast -  a much appreciated gesture at 5.30am!

Indunil (executive sous chef)
who made sure we were satisfied with the food. He was kind enough to accommodate our requests in the restaurant and offered us with various things to pamper us. He went above and beyond the call of duty to show us around the hotel operations. It was an eye-opener to see how much work the staff goes through to make it happen, and I have a new respect for the hotel for implementing amazing sustainable initiatives with water and electricity. He is a leader material and ambassador for the hotel.

Sachini at the reception.
She made sure rooms were ready on time and she convinced us to make it for the morning buffet after our half-day safari trip :).

Dharmasiri (Lifeguard)
He was super friendly and accompanied us, showing us around the beach area and making sure we were safe. He also briefed us about the hotel's history, seasons, sea currents, and various other info. He is also a good ambassador for the hotel and tourists. An uncut gem in the staff.

Sameera (Operations)
He is the master of all wisdom behind the scenes / operations. From electronics, electrical, to water management, he knows everything, and he is the glue of the staff and processes, and the go-to man for any technical issue. He also has an ability to describe the process like a good lecturer :).

All in all, a wonderful hotel with great staff. Oh, did I mention that the food was top-notch too? They can give a good run for the money to some of the other 5-6 star hotels. I think Indunil and team are doing a great job in the kitchen to create excellent quality food. And with warm staff in the restaurant areas, it's like icing on the cake.

isurul2020,"DO NOT BOOK this hotel if you’re planning to at least till next month. There’s an ongoing construction going on in this property whole day, starting from 8AM all you hear is a loud drilling noise. I was extremely frustrated the fact that i couldn’t rest during the day at all. This was a huge disappointed from a hotel like this. You can call and check with the property directly and ask before making the booking to avoid this situation. 

Rooftop bar is closed for renovations( one of the reasons for me to pick this hotel was also their rooftop bar ☹️) 
Rooms are clean but dark, i was not a fan of the lighting .But may be for some people it will work. For me you cant figure out something is white or yellow. 
No mirror in the room. You have to go to washroom all the time to use the mirror which i found very very annoying and the mirror also a half torso so you cannot see your full outfit. For me this is s big NO. 
There was no ventilation system in the washroom. Wasroom door was quite annoying because of the way it closes with a noise.

The staff? Incredible. They were so nice and attentive the entire time, making the stay even more enjoyable. And the food was good! Don’t expect 5-star gourmet meals, but for the price, it was definitely great value. I even treated myself to a cocktail 🍹.

The best part? The pool! I wasn’t expecting it, but I ended up having both dinner and breakfast by the pool, and it was such a pleasant experience.

Overall the food was very good, especially if you went for the Sri Lankan options. Some of the staff did not speak a lot of English but they were really friendly so that wasn't a problem. The best part about our room was the big windows and the views of the mountains and the paddy fields. Watching the sunrise  over the mountains and the monkeys jump around in the trees, while listening to the monks chanting and the peacocks calling was a very special way to start the day. Definitely one of the highlights of my holiday. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that some of the furniture (deckchairs etc) have definitely seen better days. I was quite surprised by this given that the Planters Bungalow is not at all cheap by Sri Lankan standards.  Also the lay out by the pool was not great. The deckchairs along the edge of the pool were so close to the edge of the pool that you had to literally climb over one to get to the next one. However  in the grand scheme of things, these were minor gripes. Overall we had a really enjoyable stay. P.s. For anyone who is worried it's a bit far out of town, i can only say that once you have seen the chaos of backpacker Ella, you will probably be very glad to be a bit out of town and to get back to the peace and serenity of Ella Planters Bungalow.",All about the views,Ella Planters Bungalow,-0.6905363357420602,-0.7649882739728273

The staff were friendly, helpful and informative with a personal touch. Everyone was warm and welcoming, especially Sarath who helped us daily and told us a lot about the culture and recommended local sites to visit.

It is slightly outside Ella town but the hotel had a tuk tuk and driver which you could book. They were always prompt and on time too which isn't always the case in Sri Lanka.

The breakfast was traditional and delicious and we also ate here some evenings and the traditional Sri Lankan dishes were fantastic.

annebR187AT,"Dies ist ein sehr luxuriöses, aber auch persönliches Hotel. Die Anlage ist sehr gepflegt und die Zimmer sind in zwei Gebäuden verteilt. Es gibt einen sehr schönen grossen Pool und überall über das Gelände verteilt Sitzmöglichkeiten. 
Man isst im Garten, das Essen ist sehr gut, man bekommt Sri Lankische und indische Spezialitäten, aber auch Europäisches Essen. Das Preis-Leistugs-Verhältnis ist sehr angemessen. 
Wir hatten das Glück zwei Deluxe-Zimmer zu bekommen, die sehr groß sind, sehr modern ausgestattet und eine absolut umwerfende Aussicht durch große Panoramafenster haben. Die Fenster lassen sich verdunkeln und es gibt eine AC. Der kleine Balkon ist toll zum sitzen und Affen beobachten. Etwas störend war der Muezzin morgens um 5, aber das gehört dazu.
Das Hotel ist 9 km vom Ort Ella entfernt, man kann also nicht mal schnell in die Stadt, das Hotel stellt aber Fahrer zu Verfügung oder organisiert ein Tuktuk.

StephH600,"We toured all over Sri Lanka and stayed at many beautiful hotels but this one was our favourite by far! We are a family of four and they brought in two extra beds into the spacious room for the kids. The rooms are clean, modern and the views are to die for. 

One thing I will forever remember is being woken to massive banging sounds early in the morning. We were so confused thinking maybe coconuts dropping on the roof but it was monkeys! Monkeys jump and swing around the roof and trees in the morning making a huge ruckus but we loved it. I am not a morning person but you really have to appreciate nature and the silly behavior of the Monkeys. The staff were incredible and were so friendly. The food was the best food during the entire vacation as well. It isn't a full-service hotel but it is such a special find that really feels cozy and welcoming.

The hotel is so quiet and relaxing, they grow their own veg, fruit and herbs and one of the staff kindly showed us around the grounds and explained what was growing which was really interesting! Breakfast was western or Sri Lankan and plenty of choice, so lovely to sit outside in the peaceful surroundings and enjoy breakfast! The only thing we would say and we fed back to the hotel, was that it would be nice to have a little fridge in the room to keep our water cool/after sun but other then that it was a really nice place to stay.

laviniam,"We stayed two nights in this interesting place. It is a hotel / organic farm nestled in a small valley among the thickly forested mountains of Ella. The hotel guests are taken to the hotel on their 4 x 4 vehicles along a winding and badly maintained narrow road. The road ends halfway down the mountain at a cable car station and the final part of the journey is on a cable car that deposits the guests right at the main building in the compound that serves as the cable car station and the hotel lobby. The rooms of the hotel are in chalets that are on the banks of a river that goes around the property. The farm grows all the food that is served at the hotel and the food served is totally vegetarian. They grow their own rice and most of the vegetables. The best vegetarian food that I have tasted in a long time.

They will take you on nature hikes in the surrounding mountains that have waterfalls. Apparently, they have a zip line as well, but we never saw it or tried it. Once you are on the property only sounds you hear are the flowing water and bird calls during the day and an amazing orchestra of sounds by frogs and other night creatures at night. Perfect place to get off the grid and relax for a few days. We were hoping to do the forest hike that takes you to a waterfall, but it was raining that day on and off, they said that it is not advisable to do it as there will be leeches after the rains.

Few drawbacks, the internet was poor to non-existing. I suppose when you go off the grid, you don’t need social media.  The chalets (at least the one we stayed at) had unprotected ledges with steep drops.  I would be nervous to take young kids here.  Also, the elevated wood-planked pathways to some of the chalets needed repair and maintenance and need better lighting, especially during the night.  These were minor inconveniences; we had a person with mobility issues, so we were aware of them more.  
The hotel also could use an internal communication system such as phones so that one could call the hotel staff in an emergency.  Fortunately, our mobile phones had strong signals and we had the numbers of hotel staff to contact them if a need arose. The hotel staff is very friendly and we had a few interesting conversations with them about various things.

A word of caution to people who do not like insects, do not go here!  For others, who like the outdoors and like to spend a couple of days off the grid, with just bird calls and sounds of flowing water as background noise, this is a fantastic place.",Lovely place - in the middle of a forest valley,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-0.7649882739728273

Meneer_John1987,"Ella Jungle Resort provides a unique & unmatched arrival with a jungle ride & cable car trip to get you to the reception area. Note that you’ll need to accommodate ~20-25 minutes for this, as you’ll be driven all the way down into the valley. 

The resort itself is all around social and environmental good, with locally grown vegetables and farmers from the area (who want to) being trained into hospitality staff.

The area has a lot of things to do and our stay came with two green activities. The resort only has ~ 35 rooms on this huge terrain, meaning you can walk around with a lot of freedom and little other people around. Very relaxing. 

The room is spacious and simple. The balcony we had with our room offered a river view. You’re in the midst of nature and the room has an open set-up, so expect squirrels and ants to come for your food. 

Even better if would be for the staff to be a bit more timely. It would be great if the final bill was already prepared in advance or that rides up with the cable car & truck would be going as per plan, so that we don’t come into a squeeze.","Unique, relaxing experience",Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-0.7649882739728273

137sumuduf,"6 of us did this on April 2021. All Sri Lankans.

This is one of the most beautiful places I have visited in Sri Lanka. The big land itself is an eco system and the management has taken effort to have minimum impact to the environment. The rooms we stayed were big and comfortable. There are activities such as hiking and zip line. The two team members who guided un on the hike were very friendly and experienced. There is a considerable drive from the main road to the start of the cable car (which seemed to be the only option to get to the resort), and this road consist of rough terrain and need a 4x4. The property have their own vehicle to take guests in. Food served is only vegetarian (eggs included) and no alcohol is served. We took a guitar with us and it was alright. The cable car was a local invention driven by an old land rover engine and this was fascinating. I hope the safety of it has been verified by qualified engineers and regularly ensured as well. We got very late to come but the management made sure to keep us food reserved.

Things to improve:

1. When we booked initially, we were told we can drive our own vehicle up to the cable car if we have a 4x4. However when we got there (in a 4x4) the person on the top of the road told we have to take permission to drive our own vehicle. The other method of transport was a hilux single cab transformed into a vehicle carrier. I think its ok to have hotel policies but they have to be clearly communicated. I am a 4x4 enthusiast and I like to drive on a rough road. 

2. Upon arrival we were briefed about the property and that we are eligible for two activities, which is a zip line and a hike. We were also told that breakfast will be ready by 7.30. However we were not given a clear timeline. You go to a resort to relax and we were having breakfast around 9.45 when the front office manager very politely asked as to finish the breakfast soon as the zip line has already started and all guests will be given a briefing at once. We were clearly not ready for it, so we have to give that up. I wish the front desk manager clearly informed us the timeline. After that, we were taken on a hike, and the guy who guided us told at start that we can have a bath from a natural pond, but changing is not possible and we have to wear something to suit that. This was also not briefed initially at arrival about what to wear or what to take as this could have become a problem, especially for ladies.

Conclusion 
It is a lovely place to be. Surely within my top 5 favourite places in Sri Lanka. If you can enjoy a vegetarian local meal and skip some alcohol, its a great place to visit. Be mindful about the communication concern I mentioned and also stay there atleast for 2 nights.",A must visit place,Ella Jungle Resort,-0.458630840368478,-0.7649882739728273

The staff is very courteous but the follow up on the service is missing. I asked for a hot pack, it was twice confirmed to me but never delivered till I had to escalate the issue with the duty manager. Similarly with the laundry service. I had to follow up 4 times before laundary was picked up. My package included 1 hr complementary spa. I was staying for 3 days but the spa was booked for all 3 days! What was the use of complementary spa package if no slot is available. Anyway, after pushing the issue with the duty manager, spa was promptly arranged.

The therapist assigned to me was Nilupa. She was amazing and very professional. She asked me my specific requirements, where she needs to focus. After that, for next 1 hour, I just slept off!

1.	Good Points
a.	This hotel is isolated, in the middle of the jungle. There is no bars or restaurant outside of this hotel. It’s peaceful and quiet.
b.	The room and toilet were clean.
c.	The staffs were friendly and very accommodating to our requests.
d.	The hotel has a bar near the restaurant, and roof top bar. The cocktails served was good. This was my personal favorite.
e.	The buffet breakfast had decent amount of food variety, mostly Indian food of course, and it was all tasty.
f.	The pillow and bed was just OK, not the greatest, but will do.
g.	The check-in and check-out process was fast.
h.	All the staffs spoke decent to good, English.

2.	Bad Points
a.	I paid USD250 Per Night (including taxes) for the Jungle Chalet room. The amenities in the room were somewhat limited.
b.	The hotel does have a swimming pool but you wouldn’t want to swim in it. They are plenty of stray dogs in the hotel compound. God know if they have used it as well, when there’s no crowd. 

3.	Will I return again to this hotel?

He ensured my family and I were well taken care. The hotel room was very nice. The shower was large which was a plus for me. Only thing I would suggest is an operational bar near the pool. I live in a desert so the fresh air and views of the mountains was literally a breath of fresh air 😉

MickeyButters,"Did not have a pleasant stay there. My complaint are mostly service related. They don’t even provide complimentary toothbrushes, toothpaste, Slippers in the room, that is also a cold place like Nuwara aliya. not even complimentary coffee sachet. First time experienced something like that. If you are checking out, you have to carry your own luggage. Most awkward thing was, whenever we placed order from in-room dining, they serve uncovered food, which was all the way coming from the kitchen to your room uncovered, which we found extremely unhygienic, and if you order anything from in room service, they always repeatedly insist you to pay on spot, as if we are buying food from food court counter. Their buffet spread was nice. 
We booked for three days, luckily we spent most of the time outside. If we ever visit nuwara Aliya again, this hotel would be a big “No” for us. Apart from this hotel we stay we stayed in Taj Bentota, Radisson blu, Galle face hotel. The hospitality was top notch and we had really good time in those places.",Overall dissatisfied,Araliya Red,-0.2837256856086045,-3.1121113872985475

roseh585,"This is supposed to be a 5 star resort but from a visual perspective it is pretty tired and a more realistic rating in our opinion would be 3 to 4 stars.

It's location is very remote and without your own transport the hotel is your only option for dining and entertainment, and it's not cheap. We were going to play a game of pool on a table with paper thin felt and several small tears, however an hourly charge of 5000 rupees was not an amount we were prepared to pay.

The pool is nice, the water a good temperature but the surrounding decking is not in good condition. 
We stayed 3 nights which was way too long as there is little to do.
We did enjoy the bed which is large and comfortable with nice big pillows.
Food was okay, there is a good variety for breakfast but each day it was the same.

winstonalfred228,"Stayed here in June, stayed on 2nd FL. I was disappointed at the infamous design of Jetwing. Although the room is spacious and clean, the bathroom was the size of a basketball court. I find a few really annoying factors: 1) The bathroom ceiling has a gap for use of the sun light, however it’s letting all the flies and mosquitos in, my room has enough flies in a day and it’s very very annoying, no mosquito net in bed so you will have flies in your face the whole night, not to mention if you order room service. I suggest to at least put a mosquito net there to keep the mosquito out. Secondly, this gap is letting all the humidity in the bathroom, which means all the clothes and towel hung in the bathroom will never dry. The hangers are the really old school ones that can only be hung inside the closet, there is nowhere else to hang it, consider you have an amazing pool, don’t you think people will need a place to hang their swim suits? 2) The balcony canopy has no cover but strips of wood, when it rains, the whole balcony is 100% expose to rain, you can’t sit there and enjoy the view. When you come in June, the waves are super big, you won’t be allowed to swim in the private beach, please beware, because it’s dangerous. The only good thing is all the staff here are very friendly , hospitable and polite, they are the only ones who made my stay pleasant. Restaurant has BBQ buffet at night, it’s amazing!!",Disappointed at design but super nice service!!,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,-1.9385498306356874

The rooms are clean and well equipped, and the staff are friendly and helpful. However, the rooms are very worn and worn out. Should be renovated .

yangboz2023,"I really love this hotel. If you're planning a trip to Yala National Park, this is a great choice. The rooms are spacious, and the food selection is better than other hotels in the same price range. The pool is a standout feature—it's huge and has a shallow area for kids.

We headed out for a safari at 5 AM this morning. Since it was too early for breakfast, we asked the front desk, and they packed sandwiches, eggs, fruit, and coconut water for us. This was a really nice touch and showed how thoughtful their service is. Having food available for guests heading out early to the park is super important.

We've been in Sri Lanka for a week now and have stayed at similarly priced hotels, but this one is the best by far. Tomorrow we're off to Galle, staying at another Jetwing hotel, and we're really looking forward to it.",Great choice is Yala Area,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,0.4085732826900327
L9465LNkarenh,"We stayed for 2 nights in this beautiful hotel. The first night was like being tortured in paradise because although the hotel is very good with wonderful staff and a beautiful environment within the Yala Nature Reserve, they had hosted a private drum & bass dance party on their beach frontage with lazer lights and exceptionally loud music. We thought that they would stop at 10:30pm but it went on at the same decibel level until 2:30am the next day. As this is a hotel in a National Park we did not expect this level of sound pollution for ourselves or the wildlife. As we were here to see the wildlife we had pre booked an early morning jeep safari which left the hotel at 5:30am. Suffice it to say we had max 2 hours sleep and were exhausted. Our wonderful guide spoke to the Manager on duty about the unacceptable experience that we had received and he was told that it had been out of their control! It was a party on their private beach and the guests were all part of a large group staying in the hotel! I fail to see why they felt that the other guests did not deserve a peaceful night in a peaceful location. The resort is marketed as an ecofriendly peaceful location with minimum impact on the pristine natural environment. This is not the type of wildlife that we expected!",Should come with a health warning,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,-1.9385498306356874

Fonseka777,"We recently spent 4 days at Jetwing Yala, a fabulous hotel. As you would always expect from a typical Jetwing Hotel our stay was very rewarding. We are determined to visit all the Jetwing hotels in Sri Lanka and this was the 4th Jetwing property we ticked from our bucket list. Yala General Manager Naminda Rathnayake was a down to earth people person who took time to meet and greet every visitor not once but many times during our stay. The example he set flowed through to his staff who were right on the money when it comes to customer care...always a smile or a phone call away. We met this amazing waitress Sanduni Nisansala who met all our restaurant needs so attentively, and waiter Menuwan who was just a glance away looking after even all our requests. Chef Madushan Herath went out of his way to accommodate all our special requests. Its a pity to see some visitors spending only a single night or two in this fabulous hotel as that short a period would not do justice to experience the amazing service dished out by this choice property.",Amazing service at Jetwind Yala...a hidden jem..!,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,0.4085732826900327
Nelanga,"The hotel is placed on a beautiful location with empty beaches. We loved relaxing by the pool and taking walks on the beach where the lifeguards gave us some beautiful big shells they had collected. 
All the staff were very friendly, including the ones at the pool, restaurant, beach, the cleaning staff and those at reception. The head chef helped us to find out where their products are from (as we wanted to purchase). The food was delicious. 
The pool was huge and nicely located with trees all around. The pool was water was a bit hot but that’s to be expected with the sun shining all day in April and we still loved getting in to it! 
The room, balcony and the bathroom were spacious. Bed was massive with plenty of soft pillows. We took a triple room for 3 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. 
The usual items such as tea coffee, toiletries, bathrobes and slippers were in room and they topped up when requested and when cleaned. The room was cleaned daily. 
Would recommend booking a room with sea view and perhaps at the far end of corridor so you are closer to view of sea and beach (if you don’t mind walking a bit). A very big thank you to the hotel for allowing us to charge our electric car. They didn’t even charge us for it.

NilushanDPS,"This is my first visit to Jetwing Yala. Firstly, the architecture of the hotel is wonderful and it blends nicely with the environment here. Felt it is not second to Jetwing Light House designed by Jeffery Bawa, the most famous architect in Sri Lanka. Bedrooms and bathrooms were quite spacious with beautiful interior design in bedrooms. 

Next, the hospitality and service by the hotel staff were very good despite their busyness (the hotel was almost full that day). I saw this in most of the Jetwing hotels and they didn’t miss the Sinhala touch as usual. Food variety and taste were good in buffet dinner and breakfast. They had more than 4 action stations in each buffet as I remember.
 
They accommodated a date change request without any fuss and according to my experience, both Jetwing and Cinnamon hotel chains are flexible while their standards especially food are pretty good. One highlight was that they have kept a complete set of toiletries. This included the shaving and dental kits which most of the hotels at this level do not provide now.
 
The swimming pool is quite long and can accommodate many people at a time. It’s only 4 feet deep across the board.  There is also an adjoining children’s swimming pool which is only 1.5 ft deep. Water was unusually warm on this day which should be due to the current hot weather in the country. You can also access the beach and relax which we did; there are some huts with benches, sunbeds, etc for this purpose. A lifeguard is in service and swimming in the sea was not possible on this day due to the rough sea. This is one of the best places to arrange a Safari to Yala National Park. However, we were not interested as we just wanted to relax after the visit to Katharagama in the morning.
  
Do remember to not to keep any fruits and food in your vehicle because elephants frequently visit this hotel! If they feel there is food inside your vehicle, they may damage your vehicle to eat them! (some time back they have done it). However, do not worry too much about it as long as you take little precautions as mentioned. This seems to be quite normal for this hotel. During our stay also one elephant called ‘Netta Kota’ (in English ‘Short Tail’) came around 9.30 in the night. Shown by hotel staff, we were watching this elephant and his behavior was quite calm. Heard that it has left the hotel only in the morning. It had damaged a wooden fence though.  As told by the hotel staff, Netta Kota is a more frequent visitor and harmless. As we got to know, fences and taps on the ground floor have been designed in a way that they are easily breakable and repairable.

Only the setback was the room air-conditioner which did not seem to cool beyond a certain point. To my gut feeling, it didn’t go below 25C though set for a lower level. Others didn’t feel this, so I didn’t bother much about this.
    
Overall, our visit to the hotel was a wonderful experience. Though the prices have increased significantly from previous levels, it was great value for money compared with other hotels!

Our rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable each fitted out with with some very stylish furniture and fittings. We used the pool to cool off in the late afternoon. The Cloud cafe was closed for renovations during our visit so we used the Loft Lounge Bar in the evenings and enjoyed the substantial breakfasts at the poolside in the morning before heading out on our visits. The hotel has a very accessible location whilst remaining  a peaceful sanctuary set within the heart of the city. The eco friendly approach adopted by the hotel team is to be admired.

Our room had it's own loggia, it's own outside dining area and a private garden area (not sectioned off, just away from the public areas). The bathroom was huge, with a luggage area my wife described as 'the dressing room'. We loved the wildlife, the vegtable gardens (including it's own rice paddy) and the fish pools.
The food was very much to our taste, especially the breakfasts. We ate at Planters for lunch and dinner, and it was delicious and not expensive.
All this would merit a five star review on its own. But the staff took the service to another level. They took time to show a personal interest in the things we liked, and showed us things of interest around the grounds. We felt we were being treated especially well, but so was everyone else!
We were woken very early morning by the gentle chanting from the local Buddhist temple. Again, this was not a problem for us, we enjoyed it (hence the average rating of quietness)!

A special mention goes out to Palitha, who really looked after us. He was really enthusiastic about food and the produce of their farm. He was really welcoming, entertaining and informative.
The home-cooked breakfast and dinners were delicious. We are them on the terrace which had stunning views over the hills. 
We had a cookery class on site which we loved (see pictures). We cooked 5 dishes together which we ate afterwards with the other guests staying at the property. Note: a recipe book isn't provided so you'll need to make notes. 

There is a lovely pool onsite and loads of sun loungers and hammocks dotted about the well kept gardens. Easy to unwind.

Rooms were very clean and the team extremely helpful. Water pressure in the shower was good. 

The team had several tour options with their in-house tuk tuk driver. We climbed little Adam's peak and walked over 9 arches bridge. Again, stunning.

W7043ATshawnf,"When I married in 2013, we went on our honeymoon to Heritance Ahungalla. It was one of the best hotels we have been to, and I speak about the experience (fantastic food, very kind staff, excellent service, super and well-maintained facilities). 

This year, after 11 years, we decided to take our two kids to Heritance Ahungalla. Every hotel we have visited since we got married has used Heritance as the benchmark. I was reluctant to visit Heritance again because I didn't want the high standards we had set to be lowered. To my amazement, after 11 years, it's still the same. The food—every dish was super yam—the staff is very kind, and the facilities are still well maintained—I am still amazed. 

Funny story, today when house keeping came to clean the room, they noticed that my kids had brought their favorite toy with them to sleep with. Before they left, they had kept my kids' stuff in the bed; when we came to the room, my kids were so happy to see that. Small things do matter, very kind staff service.",Returning after 11 years and still the best hotel,Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,0.4085732826900327

Special shout out to Chef Balbeer Singh, he took special care of us and went out of his way to cater to our food requirements. And not to mention, the taste was amazing(veg/non veg both).","Great location, great chef",Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,0.4085732826900327
ap198,"The Heritance has a good reputation amongst locals and travel agents. Whilst we did have a lovely stay, we didn’t feel it was on par with 5* hotels we have stayed in other countries or even in line with the other six 5*’s we stayed in Sri Lanka as part of a touring holiday with beach relaxation at the end. 

Pro’s:
- nice hotel with minimalist design.
- smaller and more intimate then the Riu which is located next door 
- very friendly staff 
- pool area opens onto beach and you can walk easily 
- quite location 
- restaurants food was great and there was plenty of good quality variety. 
- the hotel was not busy and we were often the only ones in the pool which was great.
- although in July the sea is too rough to swim in, the beach was lovely to walk and play on.

Con’s:
- although in mostly good condition, we felt it was dated in parts
- although we Stayed in a suite we didn’t feel the hotel was luxury, the rooms could’ve done with a bit more soft furnishings to make it feel a bit more luxurious.
- suite bathroom only has a large bath with over shower. There is a step into the bath which may be an issue for those with mobility issues. 
- there is limited number of poolside sun umbrellas which seemed a shame as umbrellas, poolside service etc, we would deem as basics. We had to tip to ensure we got an umbrella reach day which we felt should not have been necessary given it was a 5*. On our first day we were told a couple who had 2 sun-loungers, 2 umbrellas and a spot looking out to the beach and sea were “VIPs” and there were no more umbrellas. We did find a more helpful attendant the next day however.
- evening entertainment a bit hit and miss.
- could put some sun-loungers on the beach for hotel guests.

Overall, a lovely hotel and we would definately stay again however request the hotel take on some of our suggestions.",Nice hotel with lovely staff.,Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,-0.7649882739728273

ahazyw,"Good service in a hotel is essential for creating a memorable guest experience. It begins with warm, welcoming interactions from the front desk staff, who should provide a seamless check-in process and offer assistance with luggage. Attentiveness is key; staff should anticipate guests' needs, whether it’s providing extra towels or accommodating special requests.

Housekeeping plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean and comfortable environment. Prompt and thorough cleaning, along with attention to detail, ensures that guests feel at home. Dining services should offer a diverse menu, with knowledgeable servers who provide recommendations and cater to dietary restrictions.

Communication is vital; staff should be approachable and willing to resolve issues efficiently. A personal touch, such as remembering a guest's name or preferences, can significantly enhance the experience.

Additionally, amenities like concierge services can elevate a stay by providing local insights and recommendations. Ultimately, good service in a hotel is about creating a welcoming atmosphere where guests feel valued and cared for, encouraging them to return in the future. A commitment to excellence not only enhances satisfaction but also fosters loyalty, making exceptional service a cornerstone of any successful hotel.","Food is good, location is good",Mirage Hotel Colombo,-0.5859055735196359,0.4085732826900327

Amazed at how proud the servers are at their job. When chatted with Malintha, one said how he loved his job. He served with so much dedication and enthusiasm.

Particularly Danushka who served our table at breakfast this morning. Brightened his face when he cracked a joke which made my wife laughed so heartily. What amazed me was his sincere remark that he was happy to see his guests happy and enjoying themselves.

Chef Odaya has also left a lasting impression on us. Gladly explained how to make brinjal moju, my wife’s favourite dish in Sri Lanka. Even offered a live cooking demonstration. Much to the delight of my wife!

The hotel was not.  Our room was acceptable but the toilet and shower space need a deep clean. The bed was fabulous especially after a whole day safari. 

The food was not good. Bar food was poor. Breakfast was average and expensive. 
The service from the bar really wasn't good. I am glad that we only had 2 nights because any longer would have been far too long.

velauthapillair2024,We stayed at the resort for two nights in Yala. We were quite satisfied with  what we experienced  to  what we expected. The service was very good. All staff were very good. The location is ideal for thrill seekers. I believe their booking process can be little better as we ended  paying almost double because of the misunderstanding. The family was initially split into two rooms and then offered an inter-connected room. We are a family of 4 with children aged 18 and  13 and more than happy to stay in one chalet. We have  stayed in many resorts in the past never experienced this before as they would ask the ages before booking is confirmed.

On cannot open window as you will see either parking, wall or you will smell kitchen. Staff is very slow responding and do not provide fast service.

MOST IMPORTANTLY THE HOTEL DOES NOT LIKE INDIAN PEOPLE. The singer was asked to sing hindi songs because there were more than 150 Indian guests and few whites. But hotel management asked singer to stop singing and go away.
Indians are not liked by the hotel management. They want only white skin people.

Food had no label of veg or non veg and staff also not telling you. In spite of majority of Indian tourists, food was awfully not tasting anyway near to Indian taste.

SanDeeVegan,"We needed a place to rest before leaving for the airport for a 4 am flight. The reviews of Colombo Court Hotel and Spa were very good so we chose to stay here. When we arrived at about 3, we asked the front desk to book a car to take us to the airport at 1:30 am. Around 6:30, I reconfirmed the car booking and was told that the car would be there at 1:20.

We tried to sleep, but the room that we were given 209, was above the pool, a bar and a common area and had a window that allowed all the noise into the room. I had my earplugs in and covered my ears with my pillow, but still couldn't sleep until about 11 pm.

We went downstairs at 1:20 and waited for the car. By 1:30, the car still wasn't there, so we asked the front desk to follow up and were told that it would be there in 2 to 3 minutes. 10 minutes later, it still hadn't arrived so we insisted that the front desk call another car. They made a call and we were told that it would be another ""2 to 3 minutes'.  Finally at 1:47, the car arrived. No idea if it was the original or 2nd car.

Naturally, the driver had to speed to the airport so that we would get there in time to check in and go through immigration. It was raining and I wasn't comfortable at all with how fast he was having to drive. The entire experience was very frustrating and anxiety-ridden, which was what I had tried to avoid by booking the car well in advance.

We were most unimpressed with our experience here. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but this is our experience.","Wish I could recommend this hotel, but I can't",Colombo Court Hotel & Spa,-0.03620365856003366,-3.1121113872985475

Djibril45,"L’hôtel est superbe, nous y avons séjourné 3 nuits. Les chambres sont immenses (un peu trop même 😂). Nous avons trouvé qu’il faisait assez froid dans les couloirs, chambre et le hall.

Concernant le buffet et le petit déjeuner, c’est top, varié, on peut manger sri lankais ou non.

Petit bémol : le réveil a 6h avec la musique du temple situé en bas de l’hôtel qui dure toute la journée + les canalisations qui passent dans les murs donc on entend l’eau couler assez régulièrement.

Mention spéciale à l’équipe du restaurant très sympathique, qui nous a offert un gâteau pour nous féliciter de notre mariage.

Adeladytraveller,"We really enjoyed our 2 nights at Jetwing Yala, the enormous swimming pool was totally relaxing, especially with a swim up bar. We tried all 3 onsite restaurants/bars and the food was delicious. The room was spacious, it would be good to have better lighting in the bathroom. However there was one disappointment. The person on the tour booking desk had limited English, we booked a safari for the following day at 2.30pm, but the safari jeep wasn't there for us. It turns out he never booked it, they quickly arranged one, but it was 20 minutes until it arrived. No discount for our expensive safari was offered despite us saying we were unhappy. The only reason anyone stays at Yala is to do the safari so to not book us in was a serious breach. 
A lot of the pool tiles are missing so it is starting to look like they need to do some maintenance to keep the property up to a good standard.",Relaxing,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,-0.7649882739728273

Loved the proximity to the beach, even if the waves were pretty big, we loved picking shells and the life guards were very nice. Released a few baby turtles to the sea with them.
Swimming pool was nice, although but its size and shallowness made it pretty warm (and not very refreshing)
Safari experience was nice, even if we didn't get to see the leopard. Recommend camp 5 with the naturalist (rather than camp 1 which is closer but very crowded).

melandashfoodies,"This place is gorgeous and certainly lived up to the excellent standards set by our first jet wing experience at jet wing lake and I cannot highlight enough how great this chain is especially for the price point.

The hotel is modern and clean, 
The bars and restaurants are air conditioned which makes them very pleasant places to sit and relax with a drink and comfortable to dine in given the sweltering heat in the area.

The Rooms were nice but the open bathroom was not ideal. As they were open to the elements they were hot and animals get in and we had some bat poo. Not sure if this is the case with all rooms but it is for those on 3rd floor.

The mini bar is reasonably priced, but they did try to charge us service charge (which was a bit cheeky given we served ourselves!) so be careful as we were only aware of it because we had to pay this on top as we had already settled our account the evening before check out but woke up desperate for a drink at 4am as only 2 bottles of drinking water were provided.

The food was excellent. Especially goat curry in Sri Lankan restaurant. We were looked after by Antony who was wonderful polite attentive and friendly. 

Breakfast great plenty of choice bacon nice and crispy staff in there were lovely too. 

Pool area is excellent the swim up bar lovely addition. The pool however,  is like a bath and could maybe do with being a little cooler as it was not refreshing.

anilkP6033RI,"During my recent stay at this hotel, I was struck by the sheer size of the facility and the range of amenities it offered. However, my overall experience was marred by the lackluster customer service provided by the staff.

Upon interacting with the staff, I couldn't help but feel that they were more robotic in their approach rather than displaying genuine human warmth. The smiles that are often characteristic of hospitality were notably absent, leaving a void in the atmosphere of the hotel. Despite the large number of young individuals working at the hotel, the traditional Sri Lankan hospitality and genuine smiles were missing.

Compared to the other hotels I have stayed in during my travels (a total of eight hotels on this trip), this particular establishment fell short in terms of the friendliness and hospitality of its staff. The lack of a personal touch and warmth made it difficult to fully enjoy my time at the hotel.

In a setting as expansive as this hotel, one would expect the staff to exude a sense of warmth and hospitality that is characteristic of Sri Lankan culture. Unfortunately, this was not the case during my stay. The absence of genuine smiles and friendly interactions made it challenging to feel truly welcomed and valued as a guest.

In conclusion, while the facility itself is impressive in size and offerings, the impersonal and robotic nature of the staff detracted from the overall experience. I hope that the management takes steps to address this issue and instill a greater sense of warmth and hospitality among the staff to ensure that future guests can enjoy a more welcoming stay.",Impersonal Service in a Spacious Facility,Jetwing Yala,1.2997906262352503,-3.1121113872985475

The hotel comprises of three floors with just one very long wing. It gives it a a relaxed resort feel. The rooms are large, well appointed, and my bathroom was partially open and very large. 
Service was top notch, staff generally friendly and eager to help. Food was good and especially my full board lunch set menu was excellent. I want to mention here especially the trainee Dimuth from the front desk, who could remember my name, and who helped me booking a bus ticket back to Colombo.
From the restaurant, I would like to thank Tharindu and Shamin who always had a friendly word and provided excellent service. 
It seems that I was the only long staying guest, the other guests were group tour guests who stayed for 1 or 2 night. That’s why I could not really understand why my request upon checkin to be placed on the 3rd floor was turned down.

From the moment we stepped into their vehicle across the mesmerizing cable cars and the breathtaking nature it was just the start. The real deal starts from the moment you lodge into the room right in middle of hundreds of birds you’ve never seen before with the most promising flow of nature that just feels right. Finally the Food man! Kudos to the Chef for making us realize being Vegetarian has many tickles on the taste bud! This place tops up all the other nature abiding resorts, Plus it’s 100% organic guys! Every little food you eat is grown in the resort itself. It isn’t just promising, It’s the most sustainable way of life!

Last but not least, Tharindu and the team thank you so much for the warming  hospitality. It was the kind and generous hospitality that made us not wanna come back home.

Until next time guys! Thank you so much once again! Keep up the amazing route of work!

Once we were all together we took a jeep a few kms down the hill to the gondola which took us into the resort. Super cool touch!!
Thari the manager met us at the reception with welcome drinks before telling us about our stay, the property and eventually showing us our rooms.
Once we arrived at our rooms it was instant relaxation. Great rooms along the river with the peaceful sounds the animals and the water to put you in the mood to chill.

fallonfall,"We visited Ella jungle resort to celebrate our anniversary and must say it was the best!!

We were picked up by one of the resort guide and jeep ride was a bumpy one and we did enjoy it. 

Then in order to get down to the resort we had to go in a cable car. And it was our first time experiencing cable car here in SL and I believe this makes Ella jungle resort special.

And as we were warmly welcomed by Tharindu and must say his hospitality made us feel like home and all the staff did go an extra mile to ensure we are happy and content throughout our stay. 

Rooms were lovely and was well kept with all amenities. The room was over looking the water stream. You can hear nothing but the sound of water stream and animals. 

We were fairly informed in advance  that they serve only vegetarian and we were not disappointed with the food. It was soo nice of chef to come to ya and asked if we were happy with the food. 

Resort offered us zip liner and a jungle trekking which we were not able to part take unfortunately, but will surely try next time when we visit.. 

We were given a tour around the farm and it was simply amazing how the resort itself has made a sustainable living within. 

There’s much more history involved in this place which will be explained by Tharindu when you check in to the resort. 

Our two nights stay was simply amazing and couldn’t get enough of the resort and it’s nature so will definitely visit this place soon.

It was truly a unique experience arriving by a calbe car in Sri Lanka! Then we were greeted by Tharindu who expalained a little about the property and its history whilst we drand a bali mal tea. 

The extensive and well groomed property is truy magical and took my breath away throughout my experince. They have many private waterfalls on the property that are spectacuar to experince with just a few friends in the sun! I felt such a sense of peace throughout my stay and adventures at Ella Jungle Resort. 

The yummy traditional food is all vegetarian and most of the ingredients are sorced from the large farm that they have on site. We highly enjoyed all of the meals we were served and felt healthy and wholsome after.

I cant reccomend this place enough for anyone who wants to submerse themself in nature and enjoy a little adventure in the beautiful mountains of Ella.

I stayed in a chalet on the side of a river running through the property that created such a peacefull ambience whilst i relaxed in my room in the evening.

But after covid the service seems not favorable to a guests.  Most of the rooms are not clean and tidy and management does not care about it. In our room we found mice and frogs inside the room and we did not sleep at night. There was a terrible transport arrangement(single cab) from Big bend restaurant to the resort which they use to transport building material as well as gussets.  The drivers were not care about the customers at all and they did drive the cab with the guests without caring about the comfort.
When the arrival, they did treat guests as guests but nobody from the hotel cares about guest when departing. We have to carry our bags to the transport (cab) through muddy  roads without any help from the hotel side.
We(guests) were packed in to the transport (single cab) with some contractors who handle renovation work at the hotel site.

 It was really a wonderful and unforgettable experience, the day I visited Ella jungle resort. The most unexpectedly amazing place I have ever been to

I felt that I’m entering into a paradise inside a deep jungle and it was the best place to get our mental relaxation.

The staffs are really helpful and felt like friends. Special thanks to you Tharindu,Abe (our guide) Chef and driver for your arrangements.
There were too many activities to make a happy and to have a real relaxation.

The manager Thari welcomes all guests warmly and briefs on every aspect and expectations. The resident guide Abeyainghe takes you on some incredible treks with lovely waterfalls situated in this massive property itself. On return the chef has concocted some fabulous Sri Lankan dishes , all veg, so good that you don’t need meat. The zip line at the resort is the best in Ella in my opinion as it goes over a river and through trees. I had a incredible stay at the resort and capped off with a swim with a shoal of Wild Mahseer fish just off the resort in Kirindi Oya.

The cable car ride entrance to the property is sure to add to the memories, and the zipline crossing a stream below is a picturesque experience and a must do.

The property is set inside a 200 acre lush thick forest with many waterfalls perfect for a gentle hike, or more advanced outbound adventure activities.

sanduniseneviratne15,"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my short stay after Covid-19 Sri Lanka! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff leading by Mr Tharindu, Front Office Manager and have a brief history and the plan for next two days. The staff was extremely friendly and the dining was very flexible, at resturant or at the room (We really appreciate this!). The Chef  Wasantha did a great job having organising curries with field grown vegetables  deserves a special thanks. We had two  great evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience in  a  secludded jungle safe environment. We were at the thick jungle forest besides the lovely Kirindi Oya 

The second day we did a jungle  trekking which was personally guided by  Kumara who works as a Hotel Manager who has Created and instrumented some novel ideas into the hotel during Covid 19 (Viharathenna site and Organic & Herbal medicine farming) which were added extra
Novel Attraction to the hotel. Raj is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). We truly enjoyed walking the three of us through the jungle and reached to one water fall (out of 7 in side hotel premises). Just before reach to the water fall we had to climb steep rock with a rope. This tremendous experience and tested endurance of my parentd physical and moral status. . Scenery and the tranquility at the top could not be worded. We had a safe bath at the bottom of the waterfall and it  was great and so beautiful and relieve after hard  walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. The natural bath at the end of adventurous forest hike was a great way to end the trekking.
After having 3 hours Jungke trekking and bathing we reached to horel and had a wonderful lunch. This was personally supervised by the Front Office Manager, Tharindu, very humble, soft spoken and well mannered gentleman. Most of veggies from the home garden and taefully cooked by the Chef Wasantha. 
After having lunch we had a cable sliding session which cross the Kirindi oya from. The team of doctors from Baddulla hospital also joint this event. Earlier they had a jungle trekking, include waterfall descending, give me a moral boost on me  steadyness and body  balance. It was a great pleasure and experiences for me. 
Note, this is not a 4/5-star hotel or so, but the atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for the Front Office Manager, Tharindu, who does a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality!!!

We went  there with a group. Rooms are in basic condition.very specious rooms. However in a ensuite room you can hear all the noise as it is a wooden floor. 
Lunch and dinner was served with rice and curry ,it was very delicious. 
Cable car facility is most unique feature of this hotel as it is  new concept in Sri Lanka. Zip line and water fall trekking were done by Abeysinghe and he was very good in his duty. 
Finally the reception, billing was delay but could have more efficient since there were three people. There is less communication between reception and the depature jeeps. We have been waiting for the jeep on the road more than 40 mins for the arrival . We could have waited at the lobby if we knew or adviced. They do not really care once you pay your bills.

While large as a property, the outside-in open corridors with trees and hanging plants don’t feel overwhelming and there’s a real sense of space and tranquility. Rooms are well appointed but the real highlights are the pools. the open and empty beachside views and, in particular, the friendly staff and the star of the show, the food. Breakfast is a feast of flavours, with more cooking stations than I’ve seen in a while. We were lucky enough to experience the Chef’s Table, which is an opportunity not only to cook in the professional kitchens (where a staff of 70 work) but to done there with the wonderful Executive Sous Chef Lakmal Chathuranga. So thrilling to have a ringside seat while the team delivered evening service. We assisted two terrific chefs in preparing a Sri Lankan feast of flavours - prawns, black chicken, tempered rice, dhal and eggplant dishes, which we then ate in the company of the Head Chef, himself a seasoned international culinary veteran. They do say if you want a real sense of a hotel, visit the kitchen.

troyt848,"First trip to Sri Lanka and booked Heritance Ahungalla through a travel app after reading reviews and the competitive price.
How to get there from Columbo Airport - It is about 2.5 hours depending on traffic and approximately $125 AUD. Authorities clearly wanting to enhance tourist confidence because there are approved operator (taxi) booths at the airport. You pay at the booth by zone (ultimate destination)  and get a ticket. The staff member then takes you to a taxi and there is no further payment required. This actually put us at ease because we’ve all had horror taxi stories. 
Arrival at Heritance - This is a very positive experience. You are welcomed with refreshments, a friendly smile and seamlessly checked in. If you are used to doing everything yourself then you will have to give that habit away because the lovely staff will do everything.
The resort is an old building which has been modernised so it has wide open corridors and the rooms are spacious. The rooms are clean and have balconies. Tv has a range of channels and the bathroom is good quality and clean. We were so pleased that the shower had a hose in addition to fixed shower head.
Pool - absolutely no complaints. It is so clean and the pool guy is on top over it all.  The staff are well trained and switched on. They wait until you look like you’ve found a spot to sit then bring the cushions and towels and then let you relax. You don’t need to leave the pool, food and drinks are well priced. For example, two club sandwiches, with chips and side salads, plus two cocktails and a wine was about $50 AUD. We thought that was competitive compared to other resorts we’ve stayed (albeit not in Sri Lanka)
Beach - The beach is sandy but we did not not swim because our travel is in the monsoon season and sea is rough. We didn’t feel we were missing much because the pool area was so good.
Food - there’s a reasonably priced cafe with lots of options. They will actually make what ever you need work and are very flexible. There’s a pool bar and the Buffet is brilliant. With the exception of one night we ate at the buffet every evening. We were very impressed by it. There is lots of cultural options. The Resort must also analyze client origins because a few days had a lot of Taiwan guests and we took advantage of the special menu that the resort created for them. We had gluten free requirements and this was easily accommodated.
Taxi/tours - We appreciated that Heritance obviously have taxi/tour companies they have a relationship with because only a select few can operate from the Resort. We used Dhammika as our driver for day trips. All prices are transparently available so you know costs up front and can compare. We found him extremely knowledgeable and spoke good English. He was trustworthy and very accomodating. The day trip with him including a boat safari was a highlight. I’d recommend asking for him as a driver.
Staff - The staff are standouts. They are clearly well trained and their professionalism is indicative of good culture and leadership within the Resort. I can’t speak highly enough. Our late checkout was accommodated even though they were extremely busy. 
Gym - I used this 4 times during our stay. It is adequately equipped, clean and tidy and the air conditioner was a blessing whilst running on the treadmill.
I would recommend this resort if your stay is south of Colombo.",Visit visit to Sri Lanka and pleasantly surprised by Heritance Ahungalla,Heritance Ahungalla,2.8145941987091545,0.4085732826900327

pathmanathanb,"I had the absolute worst experience of my life at this supposed “5-star” hotel, specifically at their Chinese restaurant. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with complete disrespect, seemingly judged based on our appearance and the way we were dressed. It’s disgraceful for any establishment, let alone a high-end hotel, to treat paying customers this way.

The staff members, Gihan, Isuru, and Magil, displayed the most unprofessional customer service I have ever encountered. They were rude, dismissive, and made us feel unwelcome from the start. The entire experience was ruined by their attitude, and it left a lasting negative impression.

We then went for a quick lunch at Yi Jing ( Chinese ) where Ms. Shakya took good care of us. Please note that the swan 's neck and head of their signature dish is made of dough and not exactly edible.

This hotel is massive and the level 4 is completely dedicated to the Spa, Salon, Gym, Sauna, Steam. I went for a Pedicure with Divyanjalee and she was meticulous and thorough with her work. Ms. Archini was excellent with the deep tissue massage.

Dulanjana the gym instructor was marvellous and we regularly attended his training sessions at 6:30 a.m. all through over 4 N stay. His training technique is oriented to the specific needs of the client. 

Dilshan at the Peshawari restaurant ( North Indian) was kind enough to accommodate us and the curated menu was more than adequate.

The Concierge services rendered by Sugun and Dumidu were excellent.

Ms. Erandi at the Indian Ocean Pavilion was ever smiling and so was her colleague Ms. Minuri. Ms. Kavani was prompt in serving us at breakfast.

Chiran who attended to our room upkeep was thorough with his job.

The happy hours are available both at Ahasa lounge on the higher floor as well as Silvertips ( children allowed ) at level 2. The bar snack menu at the two places is different. 

The breakfast spread at Indian Ocean Pavilion is more than adequate with a very comprehensive fruit selection including exotic fruits. Special thanks to Sous Chef Chamunda Rohan for his s personal attention to our needs.

We had a very relaxed and enjoyable stay here. All the staff are ever smiling and ready to help.

The rooms were luxurious, the whole team was hospitable, and we capped off our stay with a truly spectacular safari. 

Our ranger - Rohan - is quite simply the leopard whisperer. We had gone on one other safari the day we arrived where we were able to see lots of animals - elephants, birds etc. But the safari with Rohan was a cut above the rest. He is an expert and leopard enthusiast, and knew where to focus our efforts. We managed to see a leopard feeding on a carcass and sat across a lagoon. Though this safari is more expensive than others, it’s worth every penny and I would highly recommend it. 

The team in the dining room is also wonderful. The chefs seem to cook everything under the sun - and the hospitality team - particularly Rathnayaka, Nadun, Himansi and Keshalt - were great.

_prbessa,"Amazing stay at Cinnamon Yala.
We stayed in one of the treetop rooms and it's very comfortable. Property is inside Yala National park so there are animals roaming around the property (there are no fences) which adds to the experience. At night someone will walk you to your room for safety.
Pool is great size for the amount of rooms and you can enjoy the pool while watching the water buffalos on their natural habitat. We also saw 2 crocodiles on our first day right next to the pool.
Well worth booking a safari. We did an evening Safari with our tour guide Gayan who did an amazing job and is very knowledgeable. We saw elephants, 2 leopards and a series of other animals. The animals get very active at dusk .
The park gets busy with all the safari cars but I was pleased to see a park ranger there controlling the situation to avoid disruption to the animals.",Amazing stay. Well worth it,Cinnamon Wild Yala,1.862766593118593,0.4085732826900327

Food was the best I’ve had in a while from a hotel. 
Chef Nandana was exceptional. He was there from the moment we step foot into the hotel until we left, catering to our needs as much as he could. He prepared an anniversary cake to my parents which was delicious and spontaneous. Pretty sure it made their day.
Special thanks goes to chef Udaya also for taking care of us with an amazing buffet.
Dewin, Achala, Shalini, Glen, Sanda and Jayani from the reception was so hospitable it made us feel like home but in a very courteous and pleasant way. Huge thanks for the reception team for taking care of us wonderfully.
Mr. Sampath who arranged the yala safari tour is also a must mention. He was well prepared to give us the best experience every step of the way. Driver Shehan of the Safari jeep was very professional and knew how to spot rare animals. We saw elephants, leopards, crocodiles and a bear in our safari tour thanks to him. 
Also need to give a special thanks to Theekshana, Nadun, Champika, Himansi and Sabeer.

Positive:
- friendly Service
- very clean and functional rooms
- great pool and General setting
- good value for money
- offered good accommodation for our driver

Neutral:
- Drink prices are rather high, but that needs to be expected in this area (we opted for all inclusive, so no problem for us)

Tip: Jungle Chalet 129 worked very well for us and was also close to the beach. Take all inclusive as there are not really any options around.",Great mix of action and relaxation,Cinnamon Wild Yala,1.862766593118593,0.4085732826900327

cathryneriley,"We were a family of 8 booked into the Jungle Suites.

We found the rooms had a slightly awkward design which made them a bit less spacious than at some of Cinnamon’s other properties, but they were still comfortable.  The best thing is that you are as close to Yalla National  Park as possible meaning a less early morning wake up… WI-FI was reasonably fast and the rooms were very clean.

The breakfast buffet was outstanding! The best we had in our week so far in Sri Lanka. 

We also enjoyed the Dine in the Wild experience. Tharindu arranged a lovely menu for us and was flexible about food allergies and special requests.

 They made the dinner very atmospheric with gaslighting and a safari jeep by the side of a lake in front of the hotel. And there were  lots of crocodiles to admire while we ate.

The star of the show was however the wildlife viewing. We booked jeeps and guides through the hotel. Gayan, the head naturalist, arranged everything in advance beautifully. We were the first jeeps in line when the park opened at 6 AM and our jeeps  were the only two to see the first leopards of the morning.

Our family then decided that rather than do another game drive in the afternoon, we would rather do a beach walk and visit the local temple. Gayan and the hotel proved very flexible in allowing us to make this last minute change.

We highly recommend this hotel as a jumping off point for a visit to Yalla NP.",Perfect Base for Visiting  Yalla NP,Cinnamon Wild Yala,1.862766593118593,-0.7649882739728273

371jonathanw,"As the other reviews state, it's a beautiful hotel commanding sweeping views of Galle Fort. In particular, a sunset swim in their sleek pool is recommended.

It's a ten-minute walk away from the fort's entrance and cricket ground, although a LKR500 tuk-tuk ride should land you there a little less sweaty. The breakfast there is no buffet, but they offer generous a la carte options, including a Sri Lankan breakfast, which is enough to split between two.

The staff are attentive and friendly. As we had a midnight flight out of Colombo airport, they accommodated a late check out (for USD10/hour).

If I were to quibble, I'll ding them on two issues:
1. There was some renovation work at the hotel, making our room noisy at times (so it may be an idea to ask ahead if you're sensitive to noise).
2. Power cuts were a constant feature of our stay.",Beautiful and well located,Le Grand Galle,-0.14161524736620731,-0.7649882739728273

The moment you step into the property, you’re greeted with a calm and serene atmosphere that immediately sets the tone for a relaxing stay. The highlight, without a doubt, is the unobstructed ocean view from almost every corner of the hotel, whether it’s from your room, the pool, or the dining areas.

Despite offering all the luxuries and amenities you’d expect from a 5-star hotel, the price is surprisingly affordable. You get a premium experience without the hefty price tag that’s usually associated with such high-end resorts. The rooms are spacious, modern, and well-equipped, with large windows that let you soak in the beauty of the ocean. The staff is incredibly attentive and go out of their way to ensure you have a comfortable stay.

Beyond just the views, the hotel offers excellent facilities including a world-class spa, a well-maintained pool, and various dining options that serve delicious food. Whether you’re lounging by the pool or enjoying a meal with the ocean as your backdrop, the hotel provides a luxurious yet laid-back atmosphere that makes you feel pampered throughout your stay.

For those looking for a balance between luxury, comfort, and affordability, this 5-star hotel delivers on all fronts.

nirmalal216,"We are having a great time at Beach. The hotel, service and food all top notch. The premises are extremely well maintained, and the views are stunning from the dining room. This hotel has been around for a long time but regular updates have kept it in great condition. We are a party of 10 with 5 rooms, 2 up and 3 down. I would recommend the downstair rooms with the pool view. These have uninterrupted beach views as well. The overall ambience is one of peace and tranquillity, inviting us to slow down and smell the roses. The meal plans include set menus as well as buffets. The smiles of the staff are very welcoming making for a great vacation. Spa rates are also very reasonable and well worth the indulgence. Overall a very fine experience in Sri Lanka.

Dimal was trying a new initiative with a whisky and coffee selection. The preparation from a wooden trolly alongside the table was enjoyable to watch and made the experience pleasant.

She was extremely kind and quickly recommended a tea they could offer.  This tea was a miracle and I felt better later in the day and fully recovered.

With wet hands, it is easy for them to slip off your hands and that is exactly what happened. The bottle smashed into pieces while I'm barefoot inside the shower. They were hardly receptive to my complaint and didn't seem to understand when i pointed out that no store even sells glass shampoo bottles and that's for the risk it poses inside a wet place. They need to attach those bottles to the walls if they insist on glass bottles. Instead, just be sensible and put a guests safety first by having bottles that won't break inside the shower.",Broken glass bottles inside the shower!,Jetwing Lighthouse,1.0374328940954403,-1.9385498306356874

There was a particular young man who followed up our table quite well, and he was picking up glasses/plates when we were done. I believe if it were not for him, our review for the restaurant would have been bad.

Also, the kitchen was taking ages to deliver food when 90% of the restaurant guests were eating buffet, and our order took up to 30 min to deliver a steak burger. 

This is only for the future. You could improve so much by giving the proper training to waiters/ waitresses on how to serve on a restaurant.

Dinner service was slow—a 40-minute wait for a cold cheese toastie (as we only wanted something light) —and breakfast was also served cold. Although some staff were friendly, others appeared disinterested.

Discover636072,"We recently had an amazing stay at Uga Chena Huts; the room, bed and food were just gorgeous but what really made our trip was the extraordinary attentiveness and kindness of the staff and getting to see the animals in their habitat.  While there are many great people there who went above and beyond, I have to make mention of our safari guide and driver whose knowledge and love of animals will stay with us forever.
Dushmantha was our guide and Supan was our driver for 3 days, twice a day, we were SO lucky to have them.  
While some of the tour guides just want to see an elephant in order to make their clients happy and get a better tip, Dushmantha clearly had a deep respect and love for the animals. With Supan pointing out the tinniest exotic bird that only a trained eye could see, and Dushmanta’s knowledge of the animals and the terrain, we were in awe from start to finish.  Yes, we saw a leopard [very rare], and elephants, which was so exciting but it was almost as exciting to see the buffalo neck deep in water and hear Dushmanta tell us why they do this [they have a certain oil that insects are attracted to so need the water to get the bugs off them].  We learned so much on this trip of a lifetime and when we go back there will be no other guide for us than Dushmanta.
Just one other note, one day there was a big family of Grey Langur monkeys on the beach in front of Uga Chena; they ran up to the interior pond of the resort and we were able to just hang out next to them for almost two hours [people do not feed them so they do not have the bad behaviors that you see in places that tourists do].

M7876GXewelinaw,"If I could give Uga Chena 1000 stars, I absolutely would! My husband and I initially booked just one night, but within 10 minutes of our arrival, we knew we had to extend our stay.

Everything about our visit was wonderful. Our room was beautiful, the food was delicious, and we loved the complimentary game drive. The staff went above and beyond, always kind and attentive, and we particularly enjoyed the cocktails at the Chena Bar.

Staying so close to the wilderness was an incredible experience. One evening, right after sunset, we witnessed a wild elephant crossing the resort—a truly unforgettable moment! The rangers ensured our safety, allowing us to enjoy the experience without worry.

If we return to Sri Lanka, Uga Chena will be our first choice. Highly recommend!",Wonderful experience!,Uga Chena Huts,-0.2282869981623946,0.4085732826900327

MariaL3289,"This place was paradise!

I didn’t want to leave! There was an elephant on the beach when we arrived for drinks the late afternoon which was so cool!

Food & Drinks 10/10 – this was a la carte, absolutely delicious… it was like dining at a top tier restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

Hotel 10/10 – you are wowed everywhere you turned

Room/ plunge pool 9.5/10 – The pool had leaves and some dirt in it but it was clean enough and refreshing – big enough to do a few laps. The veranda area was comfortable, we spent a lot of time here. The bed… I didn’t want to get out, it was so comfortable! The entire space was clean, smelt like you are in a spa and we were able to hook up our phones to play some music. The mini bar option were exceptional.

Safari 10/10 – The safari was fantastic, with certified rangers who were very knowledgeable. They brought food and refreshments, and I think the other cars around us were jealous of our morning feast!

The Team 10/10 – I have no words, they were exceptional! To customise your stay I think they ensure they have a member of the team that speaks the guest language, they do take a picture of you with your country flag (just for staff information), as far as I am aware it’s not share externally, but I thought this was a cute touch. They were so accommodating, and made you feel safe at all times – the resort was in the reserve and its open to all animals, so you can see what Yala National Park has install for you! I will definitely go back.

The rooms are jaw-dropping, the situation (part jungle/part beach) extraordinary, the food remarkable given the remote location and, best of all, the  staff were just superb. Every single one of them. But special mentions must go to the delightful Chinthaka in the restaurant for whom nothing was too much trouble and our safari guide Janith who conjured up the highlight of our trip in spotting, not one, but two separate leopards on a single game drive.

- the individual huts are magnificent, clean and very pleasant.
- the safaris are very interesting and you can see dozens of animals (elephants, crocodiles, leopards etc) in sumptuous landscapes.

The staff went above and beyond to make all guests feel at home. 😘😘 Thank you Indie & your team 😍you made me cry 😢 how beautiful this place really is! It’s a must try for luxury specials! Anniversaries, Birthdays 🎉 & even honeymoons! 😉

We booked it as all-inclusive - and the food 🥘 was just something special 😍😘- especially the breakfasts & Dinners were exceptionally good.👍🏽 

The hotel is so near the national park that wild animals wander into the hotel . 🏨 

We saw elephants 🐘 several times - & loads of other animals! We were delighted 🤩 to have a two day tour of the jungle!🥰

We were really hoping to see the leopard 🐆 but thought this is in once of a life time ! & probably requires more than two days stay!  We were delighted 🤩 to see Lucas the leopard 🐆 😍😘we were amazed truly!

We also saw a little family of wild boars, Deers, 🦚 peacocks, Crocodiles 🐊, a king fishers , Buffaloes 🦬 & Storks. But it’s 100% safe with lots of staff on the hotel taking care that there is no danger. ⚠️ ‼️

vinukia2024,"Firstly out of the four of us one didn't receive the welcome refreshments. We were then led to our rooms which was the suite room for four. However, there was only one deluxe bed and the other two beds were where the sofa was supposed to be. So it was not comfortable at all and it was very crowded in the room. Not worth the price at all. The deluxe bed was however comfortable so I suggest you get two deluxe rooms and never a family suite. There was a jacuzzi that didn't work. So overall pretty useless. Moreover, moving to buffets. The chairs in the dinning area are way too heavy, you burn all your calories trying to lift your chair up every time. The buffet times are 7:30-9:30 so everyone comes around 8 making it very crowded. We were said to stay in the waiting area till a table is free. The food is not refilled until the customers pester the chefs and managers. Not so close to Sigiriya rock. During this vacation I stayed at a three different hotels and comparing them all made me realize it was foolishness to spend this amount for this so called hotel. Highly not recommended.

The bathroom was dirty and almost like being outside. They had thin grates used as a partition to the garden - let all sorts of wildlife through.

We viewed various other rooms which were equally as bad- this is not a luxury hotel and no more than a 2 star hotel.

Special thanks to Tyrone and Sanjana for their exceptional care. 
The hotel is well-maintained with high service standards and a good buffet spread. However, improving fresh juices by not adding water could enhance the quality. The best Club Sandwiches were on the À la carte menu, and the pastry chefs excelled with traditional bakery items.

FellowTraveler79670,This Hotel is definitely 5 star with a view of Galle Fort and the beach from poolside.  The weather turned on us and it rained a lot but the luxury of this hotel made up for the weather.  The staff were friendly and the rooms spacious and clean.    The artwork in the reception area and basically everywhere was amazing I could of looked at the artwork all day.  The only bar is at the Pool Bar - this became a problem when the weather became quite wild and made it difficult for anyone to be at the Pool Bar without getting drenched.  I think maybe another bar in the Blue Restaurant might be the solution so staff won't get wet delivering drinks from the Pool Bar.  Having said this the staff looked after us very well whilst we sat in the Blue Restaurant waiting out the rain.  We would definitely come back to this hotel on another trip to Sri Lanka.,Luxurious and we were very spoilt.,Le Grand Galle,-0.14161524736620731,0.4085732826900327

Her birthday celebration was overlooking the sigiriya rock and it was splendid to have a cool backdrop unlike the usual cake cutting . So we are sooo happy for you and your team’s tremendous service .

Not forgetting the most talented chef in house ; Many thanks to you Chef Manjula for treating us to the fullest . We felt like home .

ホテルからシギリヤロックを見るだけでとても感動的な印象を受けます。

建物は年数もありそこまできれいというわけではないですが十分
強いて言うならベッドの枕元にコンセントが無かったのが不便だったぐらいです。

スタッフの皆さんはとてもフレンドリーで話しやすく、
英語が苦手な日本人夫婦でも不自由なく過ごすことができました。

食事はビュッフェスタイルでしたが、スリランカカレーだけでなく
選択肢が色々ありますので困るようなことはないと思います。

他のホテルにも宿泊しましたがここのビュッフェのカレーが一番おいしかったです。

・孔雀

dnaruka,"What an utterly stunning location! Really beautiful, right at the edge of the Indian Ocean, almost at the Southern tip of Sri Lanka. The location is top notch and simply for that the hotel is worth heading to. The architecture of the hotel is not ostentatious but blends with the environment around. The rooms are very large, very nicely done up, with individual balconies, large window and door looking out on the tiny beach and the ocean beyond. Washroom within the rooms was very large and comfortable with all the usual Jetwing toileteries.

Service, while fine, needs refinement, as it ranges from good service with a smile to downright grumpy in the main restaurant. Some hotel workers are very pleasant but others seem not keen on their jobs and this was more glaring at the main restaurant than in other locations. The management needs to invest more in training to the staff.

The food also was not the best among the Jetwing hotels where I have stayed in Sri Lanka, and at best can be rated as 2.5 out of 5. Location would get a 4.75 out of 5.

LetsGoSightseeing,"The Mahaweli Reach Hotel was my accommodation in Kandy. Having reached it after a long day, I instantly fell in love with it. The building was a beautiful, immaculate white with the façade reminding me of colonial buildings.

Upon entering, I was greeted by the front desk on my left, a garden in front of me, and a restaurant on my right. The front desk staff made me sit comfortably in the reception area while they smoothly carried out my check in formalities.

I was then taken to my room for which I had to cross the shopping arcade and the swimming pool. The shopping arcade looked quite glitzy and had a gemstone shop from where I was almost tempted to buy a few gems/ gem – encrusted jewellery.

The swimming pool, located on the ground floor, looked ethereal, illuminated by soft lanterns placed all around it. Dip into it! It was surrounded by the garden, the Uyana Restaurant, the Tamarind Bar, the deck area and a set of rooms, making it the central feature of the hotel.

I had booked myself a Deluxe Room that overlooked the River Mahaweli Ganga, a fact I realised the next morning! A lovely bookmark, with a quote from Buddha and a Nasturtium flower tucked into it, welcomed me into my room.

The room was of an adequate size, comfortably furnished, with all amenities available, as can be expected from a good hotel. The room was quite comfortable from a sleep POV; I got two good nights of sleep here.

The bathroom turned out to be quite a different one. The bathing area was at an elevation, and one had to climb a few steps, open a glass door and step inside for a shower.
I have to admit that it was not a great design from a safety viewpoint.

Most of my meals were at the Uyana Restaurant. Indulging in its dinner buffet was one of the top highlights during my stay. You should not miss the breakfast buffet either.
The restaurant offers a delightful array of freshly – baked pastries, a variety of fruits, and a selection of hot and cold dishes to kickstart your day.

I had a drink at the Tamarind Bar too. Sprawled on an armchair, I sipped on a Mango Martini made expertly by the smiling bartender. Enjoy your cocktails while partying with friends.

And that brings me to the staff attitude. I absolutely LOVED the staff at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel. All of them were always attentive, ever efficient and tremendously cordial. Every single one of them!
I was made to feel like a cherished guest and also made comfortable as I was a solo woman traveller.

I did not use many services at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel as I was mostly out and about sightseeing, but I did avail myself of the boat cruise offering.

To summarise, Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy is indeed a good hotel, known for its exceptional service and luxurious amenities. It stands out as a premier establishment.

The breathtaking view of River Mahaweli Ganga creates a stunning backdrop as you unwind and socialise in this vibrant setting. As Mahaweli Reach Hotel is located a little away from the attractions of Kandy, it serves as an ideal resting place.",Book a stay with them!,Mahaweli Reach Hotel,0.9359254382080134,0.4085732826900327

Dilmun,"We were a large group staying at this great hotel. We were in Kandy for a school reunion and attended several well executed functions at this hotel. 

However, what makes a great hotel, extraordinary are their staff. This is where this hotel truly shines  across all departments- Front Office, Bell boys, Restaurant staff and chefs and Housekeeping. A special mention must be made of Kavisha. She was exceptionally helpful with her cheerful and winning ways. It is evident that this hotel invests in their staff and training takes pride of place. 

The breakfast buffet was mind boggling. One did not know where to start- the choices available were truly huge. No one could possibly leave unsatisfied. The chefs did a great job displaying their skills and craft.

I strongly recommend this hotel if you want a comfortable and memorable stay in Kandy.

Very beautiful resort and lovely staff

We spent 3 nights with our Romanian family friends and Belgian family friends. We flew all the way from the Maldives, and it was a wonderful holiday—we all enjoyed it. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with a drink made from orange, which was delicious. We specifically came to experience the sea vibe, but unfortunately, we had some bad weather. However, we managed to make the best of it. The pool bar is nice, and the bartender is very friendly. We really need to mention our boys from the pool bar—Prabath, Raveen, and Nayanajith—who did a great job. Thank you again, guys!

Whenever we went to the restaurant, the hostess girls always greeted us with a smile. We also met the head chef during dinner; he is a really nice person, and his team did a great job. The food was amazing. We went to the main bar upstairs and had some drinks. The bartender there was also very friendly.

At the reception, I need to mention Kevin, Rushmi, Kassandra, Sithmi, and Shiyan, who gave us a warm welcome and arranged a late checkout for us. Once again, the front office showed excellent hospitality. Well done, team!

In the main bar, they played live music every night. The musicians were really talented, and we enjoyed the performances. The hotel was amazing, and we are all definitely coming back again.

stellac579,The check in process was horrific. It took over 90 minutes and a £50 call to the UK booking agent to get checked in to our suite. We had to provide the hotel with the confirmation code that their head office had given the UK booking agent before they would check us in. It was very stressful & not the experience you’d expect from a five star hotel. The worse of it was that there was no apology. We were offered complimentary breakfast but this was then withdrawn. They also will not allow me to speak to a manager so I’ve asked to speak to Ranjan Stanislaus but emails and WhatsApp messages are ignored.

The staff is excellent in their hospitality and intuitive approach to service. They made us feel so much at home and took care of us very well. 
The villa was stunning, surrounded by magnificent view of the forest and every moment spent in the villa was so relaxing with energising. I loved the soothing nature sounds. 
The food vegetarian and non vegetarian was one of the best we ever had. Organic, palatable and vibrant flavours left us mesmerised with the offerings. While we ate its often we had elephants, monkeys, squirrels at a safe distance for us to see and marvel at the beauty of the place. 
The safari experience was on of a kind in Yala national park with elephants, leopard, crocodiles, birds and other exotic wildlife.
The sundowner with the fire ritual was an amazing experience in itself.

Best of both worlds! You're on a beach but also next to a wildlife sanctuary! What more could you ask for? 

Accommodation: 10/10
The hotel is very beautiful, big well appointed rooms, the bed linens used are of high quality. With your full package, the rooms are always well stocked and have everything you'll need to have a comfortable stay. Every time we came back from breakfast, lunch and dinner - our rooms would have been made up! 

We never had to tell the reception even once that we need house-keeping! As soon as we stepped out of our rooms, it seems that magically, little elves would go and tidy up your rooms! So that when you got back, you'd have cool, clean and refreshed rooms! 

Management: 10/10 
Not just the rooms though, be it the bar area, dining areas, beach and sundowner areas or even be it the walkaways to your room - all are cleaned and raked and well maintained - but never that you feel you're in an artificially manicured place. It's all natural and beautiful! 

Kudos to the management! This is an extremely well managed and maintained property! 

Food: 10/10
Chef Nuwan was so good - not only was our dining experience fantastic but Chef was so gracious and accommodating! You could ask for something that's off the menu and he'd whip it out for you! Everything from breakfast, to lunch, sundowners and dinners - all were fantastic! Thanks chef for the excellent Crab Curry! 

Staff: 11/10!
Everyone was so good! Polite, friendly and efficient! No matter your ask, they catered to it, and that too always with a smile! Special thanks to Nimantha, Chamra**, Gayal, Kaushika and Indi and so many others! All were fantastic and made our stay super special! 

** I hope I got the spellings right!

Wildlife: 10/10
Yala National Park is beautiful, with lakes, lagoons, and diverse wildlife. Our ranger, Jayaba, was excellent, helping us spot leopards, elephants, and many other animals. The landscape is dense, making wildlife spotting more challenging, but Jayaba made it an enjoyable experience.

Our bags were “magically” transported to the room straight from the van while we were checking in and having welcome drinks.
We were assigned a dedicated ranger  and a driver for our safaris. Our ranger, Gayan, was extremely knowledgeable and his tracking skills combined with our driver Vimuthi’s driving skills meant that we saw a leopard on our very first game drive.
The food was scrumptious with options to suit adults and my less adventurous kids. The chef was also kind enough to whip up some off the menu items at request.

Our tour package included breakfasts and a cooking class followed by lunch. The cooking class was very interesting and we enjoyed the resulting meals.  Breakfasts were buffet style with fresh omlette/egg station and all the usual offerings.  For dinner we enjoyed one buffet and one ala carte meal.  The buffet had a good selection of meals but our ""boneless"" chicken pizza and our friend's chicken sandwich the following night, both contained bones and overall, missed the mark.  Menus were available in USD, AUD and LKS, which was somewhat confusing.  I also enjoyed an ayurveda massage at their spa with one of the girls who was incredibly strong, so I found this exactly to my liking.  The rooms are fully equipped with good air-conditioning, plus fan, iron, safe etc.  Beware the shower heads though as they have a mind of their own and tend to take off in all directions when the water pumps kick in/out!

Pool is a very good size and depth, and its green coloring and the view across to the Fort make it an Instagrammers dream (definitely improved the quality of our family album).  Food is very good and the service excellent.   Hotel even has a small beach for swimming below the pool in its own little cove.  Location is on a headland right beside the Fort which is a 10 min walk away (or 5 min by tuk-tuk).

I’d also recommend walking to Nine Arch Bridge and Ella Rock along the train tracks which are only 100m from the hotel. There is also a fantastic viewing/reading platform with panoramic views.

The rooms are beautiful with a 4 poster bed and mosquito net that was positioned to look out over the balcony. The bathroom was large with a walk in shower. The balcony was big with a couple of chairs and beanbags so you could just relax and enjoy the view. We even had monkeys on our balcony one morning which was nice. They weren't aggressive or noisy, they were just passing through.
Breakfast was different everyday with a choice of western or traditional. Town was an easy couple of minutes walk into town along the railway track so the location was perfect.
The staff were great and always friendly and helpful.
My only negative is the mattress was too hard for me but you can't get the perfect mattress that suits everyone. This would not stop me from staying there again. We loved it and would recommend it.",LOVED IT,Ella Mount View Guest Inn,-0.9099486057756515,0.4085732826900327

Adams peak and the waterfall are in close proximity too, staff were really lovely &very friendly, helpful and attentive. The view is gorgeous on a good day/morning. The bed and pillows are unfortunately very hard, it is also extremely loud with dogs barking and howling throughout the night and early mornings, you can hear other rooms quite loudly, sometimes music too so if you’re a light sleeper (like me!) I wouldn’t recommend staying here. Also, I’m not sure if we’re missing something but the breakfast was quite basic compared to the reviews and what we were expecting. The rooms itself is extremely basic, no bed side tables, no plug for the sink, no hooks etc just things which would make it more practical. The bathroom is a wet room too which isn’t ideal.

every balcony on premises. We've stayed in family room which easily fitted 3 adults and 2 kids. Excellent breakfast was included in the price and for dinner you have plenty of options just walking down to town (10 min). You dan also see trains going to or from Nine Arches Bridge and you can take a no husle photo of it.  Also this is great starting point to Ella Rock just following the train tracks to the beginning of the hiking path. Sad to say but there is only one downside that we've noticed while here and that is cleanliness of the sheets and towels.

You won’t find a warmer welcome than you will receive here. The vibe is casual and relaxed. 
The breakfast a triumph, cooked by local women to perfection. Have the Sri Lankan roti and potato, omelette as you wish but If you get offered the coconut  jaggery pancakes have them as you won’t see them often. A real specialty. 
If you’re lazy like me and not mad about humidity, order a tuk tuk to get up and down Waterfall Road as it is very steep and narrow.

The food was delicious (we had all three meals). Rooms are really spacious, clean, and tidy. We booked 2 rooms (Gajaba and Harindra) for 4 of us. One room comes with a jacuzzi, and the other one had a plunge pool. In the morning, you can hear peacocks 🦚 calling. The restaurant and the bar are on the upper floor. You can see the upper part of the Sigiriya and Thoppigala rocks from the restaurant. The pool was clean and spacious.

My wife and I decided to visit the Seerock hotel, initially we were hesitant about our choice and after going through so many reviews and videos of this place, we thought of giving it a shot.

My oh my, It was the best 4 days. Where should i start from, We loved the Hotel's architecture and the Superior King Deluxe room we stayed was beautiful with an added Jacuzzi bath . The Seerock Team was very kind to us and they pampered us throughout our trip. We got a pretty good deal with Feelo which came with Fullboard and a free Safari ride.

roshanghazalieh53,"Where do i start. It was a one of the relaxed weekends i had in a while.  I am so greatful to have stayed in Seerock which was a amazing little hotel with outstanding service to be offered. Away from city in the midst of total quietness is what anyone would ask for. 

Whoever read this review please feel free to check it out . I can 100% vouch for it.  

- Location - Easy to get by via Habarana. Once you are at Habarana you can reach the hotel via Tuk Tuk. Make sure to use Pick Me (Similar as Uber). Or you could even arrange a pick through the hotel who are happy to do the needful. 

Hotel is close to Sigiriya and Pidurangala as well which is a plus

Hotel was kind enough to arrange a Safari at Hurulu Park where we were lucky to see some Elephants at their own habitat. Tharanga (Safari Driver) was very well aware where to go so we would have the best experience. 

- First impression - We were welcomed by Shehara (Front Desk) witha big smile . Welcome drinks were offered & check in was pretty quick. 

- Room - A well maintained,  clean & luxurious little room with a  Jacuzzi built in . Belive me it was a perfect fit and its  suited for a family as well. 

- Food & Service- Chef Renuka and team are gifted with amazing skillset. Every dish they offered us was out of the world. 

Special shoutout to Daminda and Krishantha who served us through the stay was always happy to make sure we enjoyed each meal. 

Thank you Seerock The Kings Domain for the outstanding hospitality. This is the least I could do for the hospitality you offered. Looking for to see you next year.",Habarana's best place to be at (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐),Seerock The King's Domain,-0.8755922360906765,0.4085732826900327
tetoida,"Eravamo un gruppo di amici ed abbiamo soggiornato al Seerock a Marzo, siamo rimasti per ben cinque giorni in questo hotel. L'hotel confina con la giungla ed è formato da un corpo centrale e alcuni bungalows su palafitte. Le camere sono grandi, molto belle, ben arredate e con un condizionatore di qualità. Si trovano in palazzine intorno al corpo centrale, essendo un gruppo numeroso abbiamo occupato gran parte delle camere. Nulla da ridire per le camere, i problemi cominciano con le parti comuni che sembrano un pò lasciate andare e con poca manutenzione. Appena arrivati non si vedeva la piscina per l'erba alta, tagliata il giorno successivo. Nella sala ristorante fanno belle mostra le ventole vecchie ed arrugginite e i mobili che hanno sicuramente visto tempi migliori. Colazione molto scarsa per un hotel di qualità e siamo riusciti ad ottenere un servizio ragionevole ed in tempi normali solo dopo i primi due giorni.

Mari-liesa,"Das Lanka Princess ist der beste Ort um seine Batterien wieder aufzuladen. Mein Mann und ich waren diesmal zum 4. bzw. 5 .Mal dort und haben unseren Aufenthalt wieder sehr genossen. Das Haus lebt von seinen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern, an der Rezeption, im Restaurant - seien es die Köche oder die Ober, bei den Ayurveda-Anwendungen, am Pool, die Yogalehrer, in der Waschküche: sie alle sind durchwegs TOP und verdienen 5*!

So ein liebenswertes, freundliches Hotelpersonal werden sie kein zweites Mal finden!

Besonders hervorheben möchten wir diesmal aber Steffi, die überaus umsichtige, stets freundliche und höchst engagierte Gästebetreuerin. Sie liest einen jeden Wunsch von den Augen ab und ist gefühlt rund um die Uhr um das Wohl der Gäste bemüht. Einfach SPITZE!
Und dann möchten wir auch Malik besonders erwähnen, der Poolboy, bei dem die Wassergymnastik einfach die beste und abwechslungsreichste ist. Auch er ist ständig im Einsatz, ist aufmerksam, flink und extrem fleißig, und sich für keinen Handgriff zu schade. Nur bei ihm ist der Pool spätestens um 07:00 Uhr geputzt und für die Gäste bereit. Einfach GROSSARTIG! 

Wir können die Panchakarma-Kur nur wärmstens empfehlen: 18 Tage Erholung pur, mit wunderbaren Massagen, Dampf- und Kräuterbädern und natürlich dem wohltuenden und super-entspannenden Shirodara-Stirnguss. Auch die Hygiene in den Behandlungsräumen ist top!

Und dann noch das Essen: was für ein Genuss! Abwechslungsreich, geschmackvoll, gesund und einfach jeden Tag köstlich und eine Gaumenfreude! 

Abschließend noch eine Bitte an das Management: das Lanka Princess muss so bleiben wie es ist! Die vielen Stammgäste (auch diesmal haben wir viele davon kennengelernt), dazu zählen wir uns mittlerweile auch, sprechen für sich. 

Wir kommen jedenfalls wieder! Hoffentlich schon im nächsten Jahr und freuen uns schon jetzt auf die freundliche Begrüßung: AYUBOWAN","Wo der Gast wirklich König ist oder ""heaven has a name"": Lanka Princess",Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,0.4085732826900327
D5577HLandreab,"Erst einmal zum Strand :

Auf vielen Bewertungsseiten liest man, dass man sich als allein 'spazieren gehende'  Frau unwohl und von Händlern 'verfolgt'  fühlt. Ich persönlich kann nur sagen: Nein, stimmt nicht. Habe mich selten so sicher gefühlt. 

Der Strand ist lang und wirklich schön. Durch Wetter/Wind-Einflüsse ist bei Ebbe oft Holz und anderes angespült. Nichts im Vergleich zu Thailand oder Bali.  Aber fast jeder 'Händler' versucht, seinen Abschnitt sauber zu halten, so gut es geht und die nicht deutsche Müllabfuhr mitspielt & abholt.

Ja, die Verkäufer von Bekleidung, Kokosnüssen und Tuk Tuk-Fahrern  (alles völlig überschaubar, sind ja nur ein paar) sprechen die Gäste am Strand an. Denn da er sehr breit ist, geht es auch nicht anders, um auf seinen micro-shop/Tuk Tuk  aufmerksam zu machen. In der kurzen Periode, WO Gäste am Strand sind, versucht man, zu verkaufen, denn davon lebt man. Sri Lanka ist arm und die kleine Hütte oder Leine mit Waren oft die einzige Einnahmequelle. Gibt ja auch nur wenig Hotels am Strand, somit wenig Gäste. Wenn man das nicht mag, ist Indien/Sri Lanka nicht der richtige Urlaubsort. Oder einfach nur am Pool bleiben.

Es gibt 2 nervige hartnäckige Verkäufer/in, aber der Rest ist unfassbar lieb und wenn freundlich verneint wird, wird man auch freundlich in Ruhe gelassen. Zudem gibt es in den 'shops' top Schnäppchen, wenn man gut verhandelt. Gucken lohnt sich auf alles Fälle.

Und nein, es gibt zugehörig zum Hotel keine Liegen im Sand, da der Strandabschnitt nicht dem Hotel gehört. Daher verboten. Aber wenn man ein Stück spazieren geht, findet man Liegen, somit alles fein.

Hotel:

Ja, man kann nicht verneinen, dass das Zimmerinterieur teilweise sehr in die Jahre gekommen ist. Vor allem, wenn man pingelig ist (bin ich). Daher erst einmal leicht schlechte Laune und das Management in Deutschland angeschrieben.
Aber nach 2 Tagen Eingewöhnung ist das fast egal. Und das MGMT hat reagiert und es wird schnellstmöglich daran gearbeitet, alles in Ordnung zu bringen.

Die Treatments sind so entspannend, Yoga & Meditation super (auch für Anfänger wie mich), das ayurvedische Essen köstlich, auch wenn man am 4. Tag evt. kein Curry mehr sehen kann:). Man kann immer ausweichen in das 2. Restaurant. Ausserdem war ich nicht zum 'Vollfressen' da. Wie man die Kur annimmt und nutzt, bleibt allen selbst überlassen, dogmatisch kann man, muss man aber nicht. Möchte man es straight und ohne andere Optionen, sollte man vielleicht ein kleines Haus buchen.

Möchte man mal woanders etwas trinken, ist die Strandbar Maharaja neben dem Hotel perfekt. Für Exkursionen ins Umland stehen einem genügend Tuk Tuk - Fahrer, die dann ein Auto besorgen, zur Seite ( Fahrer Bob spricht z.B. ausgezeichnet deutsch und ist eine große Hilfe).

Alles in allem: Ich fahre definitiv noch einmal hin.",Bis auf ein paar Mängel war es ein großartiger Urlaub,Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,-0.7649882739728273
peterfromkauai,"Background to the review:
Sri Lanka got its independence more or less same time as Singapore. Since then, nationalists came into power (and went), decided to get rid of the English language in favour of their Singalese language (Singapore embraced English because they knew how important a common business language is), a civil war came and thirty years later went, and well, Sri lanka is what we have today. A beautiful country, amazing people, horrendous diesel pollution and excellent food! 

Lanka Princess is an excellent Ayurvedic hotel specifically tailored to German speakers. This is an important point. While I was there, some of the hotel people kept talking to me in German. In Sri Lanka! Well, they try to make German speakers feel at home, and they do succeed. I am not a German speaker so it was a surprise for me. 

The hotel is a perfect Ayurvedic environment where a team of experts look after you and propose various treatments to help you get over whatever western medicine hasn't or didn't manage well. To this end, it does a very good job. 

There are two restaurants; the one on the left of the pool/pond, is for the Ayurvedic patients and the one on the right, is normal Sri Lankan food. They both offer excellent food. And as much as you want. And lots and lots of excellent fruit! Yummy!

The rooms are big, comfortable (A/C included of course) and all of them look towards the pool. There is a garden area, a pool with a pool bar. Upon exiting the garden, the sea is right there for you to enjoy(if you can avoid the irritating beach boys that bug patrons every time they go to the beach). 

Pricing is appropriate for the type of luxury hotel, and depends on the time of the year. It is managed by people in Berlin, Germany.  

The only problems I have had were language specific; one day I requested a taxi for the next day at 8:30am, and although the lady at reception said ""of course"" and ""yes"", next morning there was no car and no one knew anything about it! By the time the taxi was arranged, I arrived late at my meeting.

The following day, I requested something else and another lady at reception again said ""of course"" and ""yes"" but nothing arrived for me. The management needs to train its staff better not to say ""yes"" unless the staff understands fully what the client wants!
This has to do with Sri Lanka and the English language and its past. Sri Lankans want to be helpful and say ""yes"" by default, even though they don't fully understand; they shouldn't. 

Apart from that issue, the stay was perfect.","Excellent, but up to a point!",Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,-0.7649882739728273

Zwei große, volle Flieger sind gerade gelandet. Schon hier überall Menschen, die uns freundlich zunicken und  begrüßen.

Ich würde mich als eher anspruchsvollen Kunden bezeichnen, der einen gewissen Service sowie Qualität gegenüber eines bezahlten Preises verlangt. Sei dies zum Beispiel für ein Essen in einem Restaurant, Qualität von Kleidern, etc....oder eben Ferien:

Ganz ehrlich:
Meine Erwartungen an das Lanka Princess sowie die entsprechende Kur wurden um Welten übertroffen. Nie im Leben habe ich solche Ferien erlebt. Ich wurde von früh morgens bis spät Abends verwöhnt. Sei es vom superfreundlichen und sehr zuvorkommenden Personal, den Therapeut*innen oder dem verantwortlichen Personal des Pools, welches ich täglich über eine Stunde früher als den ""offiziellen"" Öffnungszeiten benutzen durfte. 
Die Treatments sind ausserordentlich; Ein unglaublich grosses Dankeschön an Basil & Abaya!
Das Essen ist unglaublich fein, vor allem die Suppen sind hervorragend!
Die Gartenanlage ist ein Traum, ohne Worte!
Das gesamte Personal ist superfreundlich und sehr zuvorkommend. Ich habe so etwas noch nie erlebt, obwohl ich wie oben erwähnt schon einige Reisen hinter mir habe und mich eher als anspruchsvoll bezeichnen würde.

Выбрали лучший номер, заплатили большие деньги и каково же было наше разочарование...! Во-первых - это не all inclusive, а просто full  board, в номере в холодильнике не было ни воды, ни сока. Номер правда большой, не плохой, но какой-то устарелый, ну никак не тянет на люкс. Порядки в отеле как в тюрьме: заходишь - спрашивают в какой номер, выходишь - опять спрашивают из какого номера; гостей приглашать в отель нельзя. Ресторан - ограниченное количество блюд, все за пластиковыми щитами, не понятно, что там лежит, тем более не видно, не разберешь, что там написано (конечно ясно, ковидные ограничения, но во всех остальных отелях, где мы были все-это было как-то по-человечески), мой друг ушел с ужина голодный, пошел в KFC. Дальше, выход из отеля на ""пляж"", тоже через охрану, где тебя также допрашивают, и попадаешь на какую-то помойку, где сидят человек 5 местных и предлагают свои услуги прокатить тебя на лодке до нормального пляжа, или до SPA с нормальными ценами, а не как ""у вас в отеле"". Конечно же этот отель не стоит таких денег, ни по каким параметрам! (А нам было с чем сравнить, до этого  мы останавливались и в других 4 и 5* отелях, например Сocobay Unawatuna и  Araliya Beach Resort).

The hotel‘s design, garden, pool etc are super. All the rooms have lovely views facing the pool with the ocean partly hidden behind the palm trees. My favourite rooms have bath tubs which I want, these rooms are a little bit „tired“ but I really don‘t care! They are big and clean.
The food and all the staff who speak good English and German are wonderful and the covid hygene rules in place are exemplary - much better than in my home country Switzerland.
Can‘t wait to go back and feel like a real Lanka princess! I can thoroughly recommend this hotel - I love it.",Super vacation in Sri Lanka,Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,0.4085732826900327

The food was amazing every day, with a great authentic taste! The service was phenomenal, and the host and waiters were all incredibly welcoming and helpful. Our host Traveen often asked if there was any dish in particular that we wanted to try, and arranged for the chef to prepare them during our stay - the crab curries and mutton curries were very delicious! On top of that, we greatly enjoyed having excellent Sri Lankan tea morning and evening made by two of the incredible staff - Scotty and Mithushan - who were especially friendly, warm, and attentive during our stay!

ContentedTraveller51,"We stayed here recently in one of the heritage rooms which was quite nice but extremely noisy as there were wedding photos being taken outside our room from 6.45 am until 8am as it was raining. Very unsatisfactory. 

The night of our arrival we ate dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed a few beers as it was my husband’s birthday. The next morning we checked out and settled the bill which was more than we were expecting. We were not provided with an itemised restaurant bill. Later, when we checked into another hotel we rechecked the bill and realised we had been charged for at least 4 more beers than we consumed. This is very disappointing for a hotel of this calibre. All restaurant bills should be itemised and produced at check out so they can be scrutinised by the customer.

imeshf2023,"The room with the jacuzzi is great. It’s the only good thing about the hotel other than the staff. The room is actually a luxurious room but the water pressure was not that good. Also the jacuzzi wasn’t working really well. It leaked on our first night.

Pool had no view at all and the showers and the water feature was not working at all. Several pool tiles were also broken and there were many frogs inside the pool. Also it was not cleaned properly. There was no place to take nice pictures even. They’ve ample place but not maintained properly. Landscaping is nil. Also horrible wifi 

Food was the worst we’ve ever tried at any hotel. Don’t get fooled by the positive comments regarding the food. I’m pretty sure they’ve not tried star hotels before. The menu was horrible. There was actually nothing to choose from. Menu needs to change and also only the local food was okay. Other than that pastas was horrible. I had a spaghetti bolognese and it was not a bolognese at all. They just served me noodles with beef and tomato slices 🤦🏾‍♂️ 

The worst thing is we booked the hotel on full board through another app with a discount. The management refused to serve us English breakfast because we booked it on a discount. It was not mentioned anywhere at all. Also it’s very poor to treat different customers in a different way. 

The only silver lining is Shehara who tried her best to give us an enjoyable vacation but this was a disastrous vacation.

Staff super kind but they stole my iPad and $125 from the suitcase. I put all the valuable things in the safe (thank God) but left out the iPad and money that were in my suitcase (not on a desk or whatever). The staff opened my suitcase and did the job. There were 2 male cleaners who were cleaning the rooms. Just saying.
I emailed the manager 2 days later when I found out the items were missing and they couldn’t do anything about. They said that 2 days later was a long time after the departure. Really? I am on holiday and busy discovering places, I don’t have time to use my iPad every day.

Upon check out, the manager asked me to pay additional 2000Rupes for the driver’s accommodation which of course I refused to pay. Shocking. My driver had to step in and argue with the manager as this was going nowhere. Even the driver promised not to bring any tourist in that place by the way he was treated.

Being disabled, this was impossible . I was told that the food could be brought to the room at an additional charge of Rs 1000 each meal!

I had been trying for 3 days to get a booking confirmation from them!!! But still had NO success. I travel a quite a lot and sending a booking confirmation is a matter of few minutes usually. I was surprised why it is taking them days to send a simple booking confirmation. I have made more than 10 calls over the past 3 days to ask for the booking. Also, to my surprise I found that the last few calls made to the landline were intentionally picked up and cancelled. (This is a FIRST in many of my travels).

Also, I had the feeling that the first female agent who picked up the reservation was clueless. She was not good in her English, so I spoke to her in Sinhalese. Whenever I inquired about the booking she will reply saying it will be sent shortly. But it never came in the first 3 days. What a waste of time!

Finally on the fourth day another reservation executive picks up the call and sends me a booking for a different set of days. I tried to call and ask them to correct it. But the hotel never picked up any of their phones.

So i finally decided to cancel the booking. 
I'm sure they have made a Blunder somewhere!!!
hence this reaction! 
I have seen hotels make mistakes before but the quality hotels always try to make amends and will usually try to check with the customer and correct it.

joachimw786,"Eine traumhafte Ayurveda Kur (Panchakarma) trotz Corona liegt hinter mit. 

Aktuell benötigt man zur Einreise nach Sri Lanka ein gültiges Visum und einen negativen PCR Test. Bei der Erstellung des Visums war das Hotel sehr behilflich und immer an meiner Seite.

Ich hatte mich für einen Direktflug von Frankfurt nach Colombo entschieden mit Srilankan Airlines.
Der Flughafentransfer wird über das Hotel sehr professionell und sicher organisiert.

Das Essen wird serviert und man stellt sich ""a la carte"" sein Menü zusammen. Alles sehr lecker und frisch zubereitet. Die Kur war ein Erfolg für mich und eine sehr schöne Erholung und Entspannung gerade in diesen Zeiten.

A76MNannak,"Fint och välskött hotell med vänlig och trevlig personal och god mat, men tyvärr är allt väldigt tyskt. Om du inte är tysk så känns det väldigt märkligt att kommunikationen övervägande är på tyska, ofta utan översättning till engelska, vilket inte ges information om på hemsidan inför ditt besök. 
Hotellet ligger fint beläget vid en fin strand, men området upplevs som en tysk koloni, då även närliggande hotell längs stranden är tyska. 
De ayurvediska behandlingarna får godkänt men den delen av hotellet känns mer som ett tyskt kurortshotell än asiatiskt genuint. Yoga- och meditationsklasserna är på nybörjarnivå i en tråkig inomhussal. 
Tyvärr saknas den lankesiska känslan och är du ute efter genuin ayurveda och yoga, så kommer du att bli besviken. ",Som att befinna sig i Tyskland,Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,-1.9385498306356874

L'hôtel est très bien entretenu, très calme (pas d'enfants et l'hôtel était à moitié plein). Les chambres ""supérior"" (3e étage) sont très spacieuses et le personnel, aussi bien dans les deux restaurants, la piscine et le parc. qu'à l'entretien des chambres a été très attentionné à notre égard.
La piscine et le Parc sont superbes.
Nous étions les seuls français parmi la quasi totalité des autres convives qui étaient tous d'origine allemande, autrichienne ou suisse allemande.
Dans cette région du SRI LANKA, réputée pour ses soins ayurvédiques, nous n'avions pas pris, lors de la réservation, l'option ""soins inclus"". Par contre, au milieu de notre séjour, nous avons décidé de passer, sur les bons conseils d'Ursula, 3 jours en soins. Ce fut une très bonne expérience, très relaxante, enrichissante  grace au personnel très compétent.
Les deux restaurants (européen et ayurvédique) sont de très bonne qualité et les animations du soir, en majorité, très agréables.
Sur place, nous avons pu un peu visiter la ville Aluthgama et passer une journée entière, en couple, avec un guide, pour aller voir la ville de Galle.

bertholdwittmann,"Das Lanka Princess in Aluthgama/ Sri Lanka wirbt auf der Webseite, dass man in einem der 4 Restaurants speisen könnte. Zu viert, meine Ehefrau, unsere Nachbarin,unser Tuktuk und ich wollten im Lanka Princess aufgrund der Werbung unser Abendessen einnehmen. Da wir früh dran waren, setzten wir uns in der Lobby an einen Tisch in der Nähe der Bar und wollten einen Aperol Spritz trinken, wie in der Kate aufgelistet.  Der Ober sagte uns, sie hätten keinen Aperol Spritz. Es wurde uns Campari Orange angeboten. Auf die Frage , ob der Orangensaft frisch gepresst sei, wurde dies verneint. Deshalb entschlossen wir uns, eine Flasche Wein zu trinken.  Wein konnte uns nicht angeboten werden, da nicht gekühlt. Plötzlich tauchten dann frische grüne Orangen auf und wir ließen uns zu einem Campari Orange überreden. Dieser wurde dann auch serviert, die Gläser waren fast halb voll mit Orangenkernen, und den Campari schmeckte man fast nicht, so dünn war das Getränk.  
Der ganze Besuch gipfelte darin, dass uns der Ober sagte, dass das Management dagegen ist, dass wir zum Essen bleiben. Es würden nur Hotelgäste bedient.
Wir warten verärgert und haben schließlich bezahlt, unsere 4 Campari Orange stehen lassen und sind gegangen. 
Ein tolles Management! Hätte man uns vorher gesagt, dass wir nicht im Hotel essen dürfen, hätten wir uns die Zeit mit der mühsamen Getränkebestellung sparen können.
Wir werden in diesem Ayurvedahotel auf keinen Fall eine Ayurvedakur machen, wenn man so schäbig behandelt wird.",Unmögliches Verhalten,Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,-4.285672943961408

nigthhawk,"Ich war über Weihnachten und Neujahr 2019/2020 drei Wochen mit meiner Frau im Lanka Princess. Ich war davor schon zwei Mal dort, im 1998 gleich ein Jahr nach der Eröffnung und dann wieder 2005, ein Jahr nach dem Tsunami. Beide waren unglaublich schöne und unvergesslicher Aufenthalte gewesen. Ich habe seit da in all den Jahren insgesamt 3 Familienangehörigen und 4 Freunden das Hotel empfohlen und damit fleissig Werbung gemacht. Ein Ehepaar ist sogar mehrfach wieder gegangen und auch dieses Mal haben wir ein befreundetes Ehepaar das Hotel empfohlen und sie sind mit uns mitgekommen und haben ebenfalls drei Wochen da mit uns verbracht! Hier nun ein Update zu unseren aktuellen Erfahrungen.

Erstmal sei erwähnt, dass wir den Zimmerservice, Restaurantservice und Poolservice in vollen Zügen genossen haben! Jeden Tag hat die Küche wundervolle Speisen kreiert, insbesondere im Ayurvedischen Restaurant war es ein Genuss, all die feinen Speisen zu geniessen. Das Servicepersonal hat sich ein Bein ausgerissen, um einen jeden Besuch im Restaurant zu einem Highlight zu machen! Einige Mitarbeiter des Servierpersonals sind schon seit Jahren, manche sogar seit Eröffnung in diesem Hotel tätig und es ist erstaunlich, mit welcher natürlichen und zuvorkommenden Art sie einen von Herzen gerne bedienen. Am Pool gibt es an der Bar bei einigen Entwicklungspotenzial, aber das Personal, das den Rest der Betreuung im Garten und Poolbereich wahrnimmt, ist Service pur. Auch der Zimmerservice ist exzellent gewesen! Es war eine Freude, jeden Tag von der Blumendeko auf dem Bett überrascht zu werden und on Top jeden Tag ein super sauberes Zimmer antreffen zu dürfen. Die Rezeption ist oft überfordert mit Anliegen, oder verschlampt Dinge die man kommuniziert hat. Auch ist hier die Freundlichkeit oder ein Lächeln in Grenzen. Angela ist die gute Seele, welche im ganzen Hotel alles am Laufen hält, speziell auch im Ayurveda-Bereich. Die Qualität der Mitarbeitenden im Ayurveda-Center ist sehr unterschiedlich, doch es gibt einige absolute Highlights von Masseuren, die wir kennen lernen durften und erwirken konnten, dass wir in der zweiten Kurhälfte nur noch von ihnen behandelt worden sind. Die Ärztin Dr. Ranjanie ist Klasse und sie war bei Anliegen und Fragen oft auch ohne gebuchten Termin verfügbar, fragte oft nach, wie es geht, wenn wir sie irgendwo im Hotel angetroffen hatten. Meine Frau hatte ab dem 12. Tag eine Woche Fieber und Dr. Ranjanie hatte ihr richtig gut zur Seite gestanden.

Dann zu guter Letzt der neue General Manager. Diesen haben wir sehr differenziert erlebt. Ja, er ist freundlich, redet mit allen Gästen und behandelt das Personal gut… aber er war selten vor Ort. Dies spürt man auch im Hotel, niemand hat so richtig die Kompetenz, Entscheidungen zu treffen. Schnell mal war die Antwort: Das muss ich den General Manager fragen. Doch der war kaum da! Und damit komme ich zum grössten Knaller, den wir erlebt haben. Wir waren 22 Tage in dem Hotel und leider funktionierte ab dem 10. Tag das W-Lan nicht mehr auf unserem Zimmer und auch nicht im Gartenbereich. Ich habe am 12. Tag zum ersten Mal diesen mühsamen Umstand an der Rezeption angemahnt, danach noch weitere drei Male an Folgetagen. Beim vierten Mal dann halt in einer etwas eindeutigeren Art, worauf dann der IT-Verantwortliche sowohl auf unser Zimmer als auch in andere Zimmer auf unserer Seite des Hotels kam und feststellte, dass das W-Lan auch auf seinem Handy nicht funktionierte. Es würde behoben werden war seine Antwort, doch weitere Tage sind ins Land gegangen und es gab keine Veränderung. Als ich bei der Schlussrechnung dann bemerkte, dass man für unser Zimmerupgrade (wonach ich notabene beim Check-in gefragt hatte als Dankeschön für die viele Werbung, die wir für das Hotel schon gemacht hatten!) 6 Euro pro Tag verrechnen wollte, fragte ich nach, was man sich denn einfallen lassen würde wegen dem W-Lan, das während zwei Wochen auf unserem Zimmer nicht funktionierte, denn ich hatte dann mittlerweile für je 80 Euro für mich und meine Frau bei unserem Handyprovider ein Daten-Roaming-Paket gekauft, da man sonst für jede Mitteilung oder WhatsApp Call in die Lobby hätte gehen müssen, was für meine kranke Frau gar nicht möglich gewesen war. Die Entscheidung, die mir der Hotel Manager über seinen Cashier mitteilen liess, war eine Reduktion für das fehlende WiFi von insgesamt sage und schreibe 10 Euro auf eine Gesamtrechnung von 9.000 Euro! Ich meine nicht 10 Euro pro Tag, sondern total für unseren gesamten Aufenthalt! Ich dachte ich höre nicht richtig! Aber es beschreibt, wie wenig Herr Knoerl von Kundenbindung, geschweige denn Service versteht. Es sei noch angemerkt, dass wir den gleiche GM auch wegen den harten Matratzen baten, uns doch bitte eine weichere Matratze zu organisieren, oder eine Auflage auf dem Bett. Er sagte uns, dass wäre kein Problem, es gäbe auf jeden Fall weiche Matratzen und sogar Auflagen, über die man ein breites Spannbettbezug ziehen könne. Das Zimmerpersonal schüttelte nur den Kopf! Erstens gäbe es keine breiten Spannbettbezüge und wo weiche Matratzen wären, wüssten sie nicht! Sie hätten kein Lager und müssten alle freien Zimmer absuchen und schauen, ob sie was finden könnten. Es wurden zwei Matratzen gefunden, doch die waren noch härter als die, welche mit «medium hard» angeschrieben waren. Wir bekamen dann Schaumstoffauflagen von den Gartenliegen! Foto ist beigefügt, ein absolutes Unding. Dieser Manager scheint Smalltalk zu beherrschen, aber sein Hotel und was dort los ist, scheint er nicht zu wissen, und mit berechtigten Reklamationen umzugehen kann er schon gar nicht! 

Jeder Leser kann sich denken, was die Entscheidung für den nächsten geplanten Aufenthalt im Dezember 2020 sein wird. Eine Freundin von uns, die nun im Februar buchen wollte, haben wir das Ganze erzählt und sie wird ihren Urlaub woanders buchen. So funktioniert das Herr Knoerl mit dem Referenzmarketing. Übrigens hat uns auch ein anderes Ehepaar, welches bereits über 10 mal im Lanka Princess war, sich ungefragt bei uns heftigst über Sie beschwert und die werden nicht wiederkommen! Wir Gäste reden miteinander Herr Knoerl! Teilweise will man sich wieder treffen und verabreden, wir tauschten unsere Koordinaten mit einigen aus. Mal schauen, wer so alles nicht mehr kommen wird. Auf die Frage an Herrn Knoerl, warum denn das Hotel so wenig ausgelastet sei, war seine Antwort die Anschläge Anfang des Jahres 2019 und die aktuelle Lage in der Welt. Doch Herr Knoerl, es gibt andere Hotels in Sri Lanka, die waren um einiges höher ausgelastet und der Rückflug war bis auf den letzten Platz ausgebucht! Denken Sie einfach mal nach, ob es vielleicht eher daran liegen könnte, dass Sie etwas ändern müssten? Wenn wir von Ihnen in oben geschilderter Angelegenheit nichts mehr hören und Sie gegen Ende 2020 im Lanka Princess noch immer das Sagen haben sollten, werden wir eine Alternative suchen und die könnte schon in der Nähe bald eröffnet sein. Das Bentota Beach wird wohl noch im Januar 2020 eröffnet und das sieht vielversprechend aus! Zu schade, dass es nicht möglich war, Ihnen dieses Feedback bei Abreise persönlich zu überbringen.",Erholung und Service pur gepaart mit Unfähigkeit des GM,Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,-1.9385498306356874

The staff here are excellent and took very good care of me, remembering those little details that sets them apart and makes it a good quality hotel. My room was a good size with comfortable beds. They have a pillow and mattress menu and you can choose your nightly turn down. There are two restaurants, the main one focusing very much on western food and with few options for vegetarians but if good quality nonetheless. The other is aimed at those following a course of ayurvedic treatment at the spa but all guests may use it. Good quality food but some odd dish combinations.

VickyD690,"Booked 1 week for Ayurveda, helpful reception staff, rooms nice, good pool area/gardens but liked most the twice daily yoga and gym (small) with free instructor - very nice. From there downhill. 
Whilst all German guests - not a problem but usual German subbed grab but here you can reserve beds (all made and ready for you each day) without EVER using them. All day even!!! Most of the time I couldn’t get anywhere near a dumbed by the pool yet just few people there. 
Food is really unpleasant (taste and variety) - forget Ayurveda food this is both restaurants and I have travelled the world and round Sri Lanka for a month. But worse....
The aircon is not room temp controlled but one centrally controlled. If you turn off the aircon in the rooms they get damp/wet ceilings and then bedding/clothes. It was raining and cold so I didn’t want the freezing aircon on all the time. My room was constantly wet (dripping from ceiling)... hated, hated this place and left 3 days early... really put me off the German culture, which is not correct but the guests were so selfish to their every need and GM pandered to it. He ignored me as presumably I was English so not a future customer. Ayurveda massage was below average.

Sicherlich ist das Hotel schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen, aber ich würde immer wieder dort hinreisen, weil die Atmosphäre so einladend ist. Es gibt extrem viele repeater in dem Hotel. Meine Ayurvedakur war professionell und die Ärztin war sehr engagiert mir zu helfen. Da dies meine erste Ayurvedakur war, habe ich allerdings keine Vergleichsmöglichkeit. Beim Essen erwähnte ich einmal eine gewisse Eintönigkeit bei der Dessertauswahl gegenüber dem Direktor und schon wurde das Angebot erweitert. Negativ zu bewerten ist nur der Strand, durch heftige Stürme wurde jeden Tag aufs neue sehr viel Plastik und Unrat angeschwemmt. Dies wurde auch beseitigt, aber nicht oft genug.

BeaPhilipp,"Ja, ich würde das Hotel immer noch empfehlen. 
Es gibt neuere Anlagen, mehr Luxus, moderneres Publikum, und und und. 
Aber wir lieben unser Lanka wegen der top motivierten Mitarbeiter in diesem Hotel. 

Egal, ob es um Service, Buchungsabwicklung, Roomboys geht, alle sind stets freundlich und eifrig bemüht, unsere Wünsche zu erfüllen. Die Mitarbeiter sehen den Gast als König und engagieren sich voll für ihre Kunden. Egal, ob es sich um ayurvedische Behandlungen, den Zimmerservice, die Therapeuten und Ärzte, die Yogis, das Küchenpersonal oder den Hausmeister handelt, jedes Thema wird bislang freundlich aufgenommen und eine Lösung herbeigeführt. Dieses top-motivierte Team ist das Herz des Lanka Prinzess.

Interessant ist es nun, den neuen General Manager (GM) im Agieren zu beobachten. Ein GM, der offenbar weder seinen Gästen, noch seinen Mitarbeitern gegenüber ein Mindestmaß an Freundlichkeit und Interesse entgegenbringen kann, sollte sich überlegen, ob dieser Job für ihn geeignet ist. Angestellte werden vor Gästen gemaßregelt, schikaniert und sogar angebrüllt. Zahlende Kunden werden ohne Beantwortung der eigentlichen Frage mit dem Hinweis abgekanzelt, „man schwimme schließlich als Privatperson im Pool“. Wunderliche Einstellungen zu den Themen Personalführung und Kundenpflege. Bei dieser Art der Kommunikation bleiben früher oder später gute Mitarbeiter auf der Strecke und zahlende Stammgäste einfach weg. 

Lieber Herr Steurer, ein freundliches Wort an Kunden und Mitarbeiter, ein klärendes Mitarbeitergespräch ohne Gebrüll vor Kunden, eine herzliche Begrüßung eines Gastes, eine engagierte Mitwirkung an von Mitarbeitern organisierten Nachmittagsevents zum neuen Jahr, all diese kleinen, leicht umzusetzenden Maßnahmen sind vermutlich ihre einzige Chance. Denn ein GM, der seine Mitarbeiter vor Kunden derartig runterputzt, sich in Wortwahl, Ton und Lautstärke vergreift, sendet eindeutige Signale bzgl. seiner eigenen Leistung ab und keines bzgl. der Leistung des von ihm maßgeregelten Mitarbeiters.

Ich wünsche Ihnen von Herzen eine gute Besserung! Ayurveda, Yoga, Meditation in Kombinatorik mit der richtigen Ernährung könnten da Wunder wirken, wenn man gerade nicht so ausgeglichen ist, Themen rational und professionell anzugehen. Ich wüsste da ein Top-Hotel. Ach so, ja, nein, der Chef vom Lanka Prinzess sind Sie ja selbst. Schade eigentlich. Die haben es nämlich echt drauf da, fragt sich nur wie lange noch.","Tolle Mitarbeiter, unfähiger Manager",Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,0.4085732826900327
stefanpH4839LR,"Wir fahren seit Langem einmal pro Jahr in dieses Hotel. Wir, das sind meine Frau und ich, ein befreundetes Pärchen, zwei weitere befreundete Damen (ihre Ehemänner wollen nie mitkommen) und jedes Jahr wechselnd noch eine weitere Freundin. Sogar meine Eltern waren schon mit dabei. Wir schätzen das Lanke Princess aufgrund vieler, uns inzwischen gewohnter und lieb gewonnener Umstände: die tolle Lage direkt am Strand, der herrliche Pool, die ruhige, schattige Liegewiese, die großen Zimmer mit Balkon, das ayurvedische Restaurant auf der einen und das „normale“ Restaurant auf der anderen Seite mit täglich wechselndem Menü oder Buffet. Wir genießen die jährliche Ayurveda-Kur mit besonderen Ölen und Massagen und wir lieben die täglichen Yoga-Stunden. Kurzum, wir freuen uns jedes Mal wieder darauf, im Frühling nach Sri Lanka zu reisen. Ganz besonders freuen wir uns auch über die Menschen, die dort arbeiten. Sie wirken alle immer gut gelaunt, sind jederzeit freundlich und hilfsbereit, aufmerksam und zuvorkommend, tragen immer ein Lächeln im Gesicht. Jeder ist immer auf seinem Posten, im Empfangsbereich, in den Restaurants und in der Bar, im Servicebereich des Pools, in der Ayurvedaabteilung, die Yogis, der Zimmerservice und auch alle, die ich jetzt nicht aufgezählt habe. Erst diese Menschen machen das Lanka Princess zu dem, was es für uns bedeutet.

Dennoch, seit heute wird der Himmel über dem Lanka Princess von einer schwarzen Wolke getrübt: ein rotgesichtiger, bierdurstiger, miesepetriger und cholerischer Hoteldirektor treibt seit diesem Jahr im Lanka Princess sein Unwesen. Er scheint seinen Job nicht zu mögen, denn er läuft stets mit verschlossenem Mund und unfreundlicher Miene durchs Hotel, wimmelt Anfragen von Gästen mit der Begründung ab, er sei gerade privat zum Schwimmen im Hotelpool unterwegs, hält, weil es sich nicht umgehen lässt, beim Neujahrsfest eine völlig empathielose Ansprache an die Gäste von 15 Sekunden Dauer, um sofort darauf wieder zu verschwinden, grüßt niemals und hat auch sonst nie ein freundliches Wort übrig.

Heute Abend wurde dem Fass jedoch der Boden ausgeschlagen. Beim Abendessen saß er schräg neben uns und wir wurden unfreiwillig Zeugen eines unwürdigen Schauspiels, das geeignet ist, uns deshalb für immer als Gäste des Lanka Princess zu verabschieden. Wir mussten, während wir unser Menü von völlig eingeschüchterten Mitarbeitern serviert bekamen, mitansehen, wie er, an einem Einzeltisch sitzend und ein Bier nach dem anderen wegkippend, einen nach dem anderen Mitarbeiter des Restaurantservice und der Bar antreten ließ und diese jeweils lautstark beschimpfte. Wir fühlten uns an die Audienz eines absolutistischen Königs erinnert und erlebten Schimpftiraden, Demütigungen und Schikane sowie völlig eingeschüchterte Mitarbeiter.

Wer seine Mitarbeiter systematisch demotiviert, sie geringschätzt, sie psychisch misshandelt und nicht um sie schert, braucht sich nicht wundern, wenn diese Mitarbeiter ihn eines Tages im Stich lassen. Wer sich seinen Gästen gegenüber dermaßen desinteressiert zeigt, braucht sich nicht wundern, wenn diese eines Tages wegbleiben.

Wer solche unmöglichen Charaktereigenschaften aufweist und und derartig schlechten Führungsstil offenbart, braucht sich nicht wundern, eine derartige Kritik zu lesen.","Alle sind freundlich, bis auf einen...",Lanka Princess,-0.9247843108668908,0.4085732826900327

680katarinav,"This hotel has a nice, quiet location, with spacious rooms, ocean views and comfy beds. The pool is smaller but clean and perfect for relaxing. The hotel feels like a well-maintained 3-star.

There are many great restaurants nearby, and the town center is a walkable 25-30 minutes along the coast. The staff were friendly and helpful, though their enthusiasm came across as forced to us. Some people are ok with it apparently. 

We didn’t have lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant given the inflated prices – there are more affordable restaurants nearby that prepare tasty food. 

The included breakfast was decent but basic for the price, with the same eggs, toast, fruit and coffee/tea/juice every day. They didn’t even offer the juice immediately, but only after we asked as my partner doesn’t drink coffee and tea at all. Because you don’t pay for the juice during breakfast, you get a small cup. 

The hotel tends to promote their services, like a Christmas party (50 dollars per person) or organised tours. While understandable, it felt a bit much at times. We were asked about attending the Christmas party a couple of times even though we said no every time they asked.   

The internet was ok most of the time, but there were moments when it didn’t work at all. 

While the hotel met my needs in terms of comfort and location, the on-site dining options could benefit from offering more competitive pricing.",Ok hotel on the beach. ,Sapphire Seas Beachfront Hotel,-0.8935512475169135,-1.9385498306356874

Unfortunately for myself and my husband they did not tell hotels.com that they were no longer doing business with them which resulted in our arrival at a fully booked hotel.  What made it even worse was the manager? Offering to find us a room in a very basic place for $50 a night which was advertised elsewhere at $22.

alfiob794,"Premessa: che è importante e che avrebbe migliorato il mio giudizio. Ad Hikkadua, tranne che in una spiaggia di piccole dimensioni, è impossibile fare il bagno. Se non si è dei bravi nuotatori, a causa delle onde violente e della risacca, può essere molto pericoloso. Di fronte a questo hotel, per me, è stato impossibile fare il bagno.

POSIZIONE: si trova fuori dal centro che è comunque raggiungibile in 20/30 minuti a piedi. 

CAMERE: io ho optato per una deluxe vista mare (almeno mi è rimasta la vista). Centrale, molto bella. Ho visto le altre, soprattutto quelle a bordo piscina e sono contento di non averle scelte. Le camere sono grandi e molto pulite. 

PISCINA E VISTA SUL MARE: la piscina è molto bella come la vista sulle onde. Tuttavia, per colpa mia, per essermi informato male, non sono venuto qui per fare il bagno in piscina e per la bella vista.

WI FI: perfettamente funzionante in tutta la struttura.

RISTORANTE: alla carta. Si mangia molto bene.

SERVIZI: veniamo alla nota dolente. Ho scelto questo hotel, che è un quattro stelle, consapevole che in un albergo di categoria appena inferiore avrei speso la metà. In una guest house un quinto. Qui ho pagato circa 100 dollari a notte.
1. In un quattro stelle non mi aspettavo che un paio di ragazzi volenterosi facessero allo stesso tempo: reception, bar, camerieri. Dato che ho girato il mondo, non mi era mai capitato che i suddetti lavoratori stessero con i propri vestiti, senza un minimo di divisa.
2. In un quattro stelle non mi era mai capitato che la colazione fosse servita alla carta. Considerato che non amo il cibo locale e che preferisco la colazione internazionale, i primi tre giorni mi sono accontentato di una omelette, qualche fettina di bacon è un paio di patate, oltre che a dei pezzetti di frutta, gli altri giorni ho rinunciato. In tutti gli hotel di pari categoria nei quali ero stato, la colazione è a buffet.
3. In tutti i 4 stelle nei quali sono andato, c’è un frigobar con delle bevande a pagamento. Qui c’è il frigo ma non le bevande. In questi 15 giorni di viaggio, ovunque sono andato, in tutti gli hotel, ho trovato delle bottiglie di acqua minerale sigillata. Qui no. Ti danno una bottiglia di acqua che in fiducia devi ritenere minerale. L’ho usata soltanto per lavarmi i denti.
4. Le camere non hanno delle tende che oscurano del tutto la vista dal sole. La mattina entra la luce.

RAPPORTO QUALITÀ PREZZO:a mio parere non buona. Se fosse stato possibile nuotare nel mare di fronte, nonostante le pecche che non ho gradito nei servizi, la mia valutazione sarebbe stata un tantino migliore.

The hotel is right on the beach, with gorgeous views from the pool over the sea. We had breakfast and lunch there and both were good - the Sri Lankan breakfast is excellent. It’s located a little out of Hikkaduwa - a 20-minute walk along the beach - which suited us well. 

Our room overlooked the sea and had everything we needed. 

The staff were very friendly and happy to help and we met the owner which was lovely. The only thing which wasn’t amazing was the massage - more of a gentle stroke than a proper massage. But everything else was lovely. Thanks for a great stay.",Perfect place to acclimatise to Sri Lanka,Sapphire Seas Beachfront Hotel,-0.8935512475169135,0.4085732826900327

Sapphire Seas is located right on the edge of  the Indian Ocean, Hikkaduwa is only a short tuktuk ride away.
It has a nice and well maintained pool, a large sundeck which is the ideal place to watch the marvelous sunsets at night.
Rooms – all with sea view - are very spacious, clean and have all the facilities.

Just returned from a 10-night stay at Sapphire Seas boutique hotel, our 4th visit to the hotel and it did not disappoint.  
There is something truly magical about Sapphire Seas that keeps drawing us back,    the location of the hotel right is on the beachfront with views of the Indian Ocean,   a perfectly sized swimming pool and plunge area facing the Ocean,  a beautiful beach that forces you to do nothing except to admire the amazing sunsets that bless this beautiful part of Southern  Sri Lanka whilst sipping a cocktail  from the beachside bar in the hotel. This is heaven! 
What better way to start your day than yoga with Jeanette (Hotel Owner and fellow Yogi  ) in the purpose-built Yoga room at the hotel and ending the day with an amazing massage in the new spa at the hotel  - the spa area is beautiful and well worth a visit the aroma of Lemongrass and Lavender is very inviting and very affordable.    
The rooms at the hotel are beautifully decorated, all have a sea view/pool view very good sized with balconies and, beautiful positioned bathrooms. 
Food is amazing at the hotel and in my view the best menu  in Hikkaduwa, catering for all tastes and preferences,  
Nothing is too much trouble for Jeanette and the Team who all go out of their way to make your stay memorable and enjoyable. We will be returning next year to the gem that is Sapphire Seas.",Paradise,Sapphire Seas Beachfront Hotel,-0.8935512475169135,0.4085732826900327

SpaldingUKTraveller,"Absolutely loved this hotel and all of it’s really super friendly and helpful staff.  So pleased I chose to stay here.  I elected to stay in Hikkaduwa as I wanted a base for touring, beach but also scuba diving (I dived with Poseidon Dive Station – they were equally as good).  This hotel has a great location just a short walk 15 mins either on the beach or road, or fast tuk tuk ride 3-4 minutes into Hikkaduwa. And the beach walk is fabulous if you decide to do that.  Lots of watering holes along the way!  The staff at this hotel are simply amazing and the service you receive is truly personal. Rooms are very clean and simply but well furnished – more than sufficient for me as I don’t want to spend more time on my holiday than necessary, in my room. Dining options were also very good – during peak periods there is an extensive and very tasty menu and the kitchen staff will accommodate all tastes and eating restrictions – nothing was too much, just ask!   Janette who manages pretty much everything administratively really was outstanding!  She booked my airport transfers and arranged my 4 days of touring for me.  Nothing was too much for her to help out with and absolutely everything she organised on my instruction was carried out to a T!  The hotel is just extremely well managed and all of the staff are super friendly and efficient and work extremely hard to ensure that you enjoy your stay.  I stayed 16 nights here from mid-Dec 21 through to 2nd Jan 22.  I had plenty of beach time – the beach is just fabulous and empty!  Waves are pretty big, so be aware of this.  But fabulous walks along the beach in both directions.  Supermarket 3 minutes from the door of the hotel, small restaurants outside the hotel within a few minutes walk and as I’ve already said, a short tuk-tuk into Hikkaduwa if you want a little more nightlife or if you want to try something different.  I’m a solo female traveller and Hikkaduwa is very safe.  The Sri-Lankan’s are all amazingly friendly and so pleased to see tourists after the long Covid drought!  I really could not have picked a better location/place to say. Janette, you are your team are just absolutely fabulous.  You all really made my stay in SL so amazing and I cannot thank you all enough. Super personal service.  And 5 stars from me.  Final tip – I had a beautiful Ceylon Sapphire ring and pink sapphire/gold ear-rings made by the on-site jewellers – Blue Moon Gem & Jewellery – amazing prices…much much cost effective than walking into a jeweller off the street.  Definitely if you are interested in gems or jewellery, take some extra cash, you will not regret it, you will get an amazing price!

The rooms are comfortable and clean and the one we stayed in had a nice plunge pool adjoining it. The food was excellent and presentation was something staff clearly take pride in. The WiFi was a bit slow and power cuts and fuel shortages were a problem when we visited but the hotel used generators to ensure that we were not affected by this.

JLW_Travelling,"My partner and I stayed here for three nights in April 2022. Our bungalow was beautiful, spacious and the comfiest bed I've ever experienced! But the real magic is being surrounding by jungle and wild animals. I enjoyed bathing in our bungalow's jacuzzi bath while watching monkeys playing on the trees outside. We hoped to see the legendary crocodile that lives in the lake but alas he didn't make an appearance during our stay.

One of our favourite things about our stay was the food. We had the Sri Lankan banquet meal on the first night and it was incredible. Especially the coconut dahl. However do say if you want less heat, my partner eats very spicy so he was in heaven, but it was sometimes too much for me. The Sri Lankan breakfasts were also wonderful, we loved the egg hoopers the best - you have to try them! The view from the restaurant is spectacular and you can see Sigiriya Rock in the distance.

Our hosts were wonderful. It was clearly very important to them that we had the perfect stay and they went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. I am also very grateful for the staff's help with planning the rest of our trip and navigating around Sri Lanka's fuel crisis. I should point out that our stay at King's Domain was not impacted by the current political and economic situation in Sri Lanka and the hotel made sure we were not impacted by power cuts. (They have back-up generators.) The country needs tourism so do not let these things put you off visiting Sri Lanka!

Trek60562397070,"Unfortunately our experience with Fresh Wave left much to be desired. When we arrived to check in the receptionist asked if we had received her message on booking.com. We had not received it, and on checking the messages at 11:30am the morning of check-in she had tried to send us a message informing us they could not give us our confirmed room we had reserved. The reason? They had given it to someone else the day before. So they had no room to give us for our reservation. They expected us to just be ok with this, we were not as we now had no where to stay. After some conversation they tried to find us alternative accommodation. The first place they took us to was a right next door but the rooms were not nice. Another one only had availability for one night (we needed 2), and another one was not near the beach (the reason we had RESERVED this hotel). After about half an hour of getting nowhere they finally offered us a room with a more expensive nightly rates for our original room rate but they only had it available for one night. This was a nice concession and we took it as the kids were getting restless and we just wanted to put our bags somewhere. Once in the room we managed on our own to find another place to book for our second night.

The only person who I will say was amazing was Lesenke (sp?) who went out of his way showing my husband to the other hotel options, setting up the room they finally gave us, getting us an extra mattress, and providing us with the wifi.

Unfortunately the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths and ruined our first day in Mirissa. The hotel itself is in a great location, the beach is beautiful, breakfast was delicious, and the room we were in was spacious, bright, and comfortable (although a lot of ants).

The sunbeds are free of charge if you eat at the restaurant, which is a bonus to start with, but the food…WOW! My partner and I both had the seared (grilled) yellowfin tuna and it was sensational. Perfectly cooked exactly how you like it, fresh, tasty, delicious! One of the best meals we’ve had in Sri Lanka, let alone Mirissa!

We booked all inclusive but this didn't include any alcohol, this is purchased separately. As this is a Ayurveda spa hotel they have 2 restaurant options. One is healthy option with alternative food the other is still healthy but with more choice. The food was excellent and we tried both restaurants at different times. All rooms are pool facing and our room was a ground floor, with garden that went straight onto the pool. It was a lovely size, had a safe for your belongings and had toiletries etc. Our room was cleaned and checked twice daily. The service and staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself is just off the main right on the beach. We did venture out most days to walk on the beach where there are a couple of bars to get a drink or watch the sunset (Jani's was a favourite of ours. Great food, service and a lovely family running it) we also ate at the Golden Grill Bentota which was recommended by one of the waiters. Aida and Pier88 are others to try.

I loved the daily yoga classes, the Ayurvedic treatments and the whole holistic approach to living. Food was of good variety (dinner menus were rotated buffet style and based on various themes) and high quality, the ambience was great especially the lounge areas at night time where there’s live music. The hotel was just serene and quiet which we both really liked. The staff was friendly and warm and the little touches like decorating our bed was very much appreciated. We came away from this very well rested and will definitely be back again for a yearly retreat.

clairemarie952018,"Overall we had a wonderful stay at Karpaha Sands as part of our honeymoon in August. The hotel was beautiful. We stayed in one of the ocean front suites and it was such a gorgeous room, with wonderful amenities and décor. We had our own sun loungers to use on the beach which was a lovely touch and the butler service was fantastic, it was very special to have breakfast brought to us in the morning to have on the veranda close to the ocean. The massage treatments were brilliant, and the swimming pool was lovely. The beach and ocean were beautiful. 

Unfortunately there were two areas that we felt needed improvement which is why we haven't given a five star rating. First, there a quite a few dogs that live/roam on the beach and on one day some of them got into a fight which was quite distressing to see, especially as one of the dogs became injured and was bleeding. There was also a cat in the restaurant area that was limping. It was unclear whether the hotel owns the animals or if they were wild, but either way it could be doing more to make sure the animals have good welfare, including medical treatments.

Second, the quality of the meals was inconsistent. On several occasions the dishes we ordered were missing key elements without any acknowledgment or explanation from the staff, which was disappointing given the cost, e.g. I ordered the wok fried rice with tofu, but it didn't have any tofu in it.  What was very frustrating though was that we had informed the hotel at several points (before our stay, when we arrived via a form which asked for dietaries) that I was vegan, but no one seemed to care/remember.  At dinner for example I was repeatedly brought an amuse-bouche which I couldn't eat, and when I asked if it was vegan they would take it away- no alternative was offered. In the afternoon the staff would bring cookies to the room which was a lovely touch, but again they weren't vegan. For such a high-quality hotel, the staff should know if guests have dietary requirements. The Sri Lankan food in the restaurant was very good but some of the other dishes lacked flavour.","Wonderful hotel, but some improvements could be made.",Karpaha Sands,-0.6671115382295773,-0.7649882739728273

Les villas/tentes sont superbes, tout confort, literie très bonne, douche extérieure géniale, le tout très propre, même si un petit rafraîchissement déco pourrait être réalisé, mais c'est un détail ! (abat-jour assez taché, tableau au-dessus du lit décollé de son support...)
La piscine est superbe. Juste dommage qu'il n'y ait pas assez de chaises longues + parasols (indispensable !) autour de la piscine ! Ça fait un peu ""la guerre des chaises longues"" dès l'aube ! Vous voyez ce que je veux dire !?
Les massages sont exceptionnels et les masseuses ont des doigts de fée !
Les repas sont bons, mais pas tout-à-fait ce que nous attendions de ce niveau d'hôtel. Pas toujours très raffiné et beaucoup trop copieux ! Or, on déteste jeter de la nourriture !
Attendez-vous aussi à être réveillé assez tôt (vers 5h du matin ?). L'hôtel n'y peut rien bien sûr, mais c'est quand-même dérangeant. En effet, des chants hindoux, assez forts, provenant d'un temple tout près, vous réveillent dès 5.00' (ou même 4.45'?) + le passage du train vers 6.00,+ les aboiements de chiens... Pas toujours. très agréable si tôt le matin 🤪

mermaid285,"Karpaha Sands is an absolutely wonderful boutique hotel that delivers on so many levels.  The safari-style tents with outdoor shower create a very stylish and romantic ambience, the restaurant and bar offer lots of choice and consistently high quality food and drink. The location, off the beaten track, is stunning and relaxing.  The public spaces are beautifully designed with attention to detail, I could go on and on.  Umberto, the general manager strives to deliver a very personalised service and talks to guests on a daily basis. He even offered our 9-year-old to accompany him into the kitchen and help cook his pasta! 

Both the Sri Lankan and Italian dishes offered in the restaurant were delicious and fairly prices, as were the drinks.  We booked half-board and were very pleased that we weren't limited to a small separate menu but could choose freely off the normal menu, which had lots of options and huge portion sizes.  

Ash, our butler looked after us extremely well. When he saw us up for sunrise on the beach he offered to bring us a cappuccino.  He surprised us with a wedding anniversary cake and when after our meal, we returned to our room we find our bed decorated with towel art and flowers.  He arranged our beach bbq dinner and acted as our personal server during the evening, even taking photos and videos for us!  He also organised our cinema under the stars and brought us popcorn, it was a wonderful way to while away the evening. Karpaha Sands is the kind of place that truly relaxes you and lets you forget all your stresses and strains.  Sadly I didn't get round to trying the ayurvedic spa treatments, which looks very inviting and again were very fairly prices.

The accommodation - these really are luxury tents with indoor bath and outdoor shower and so much space in main areas - a neat little kitchenette area , tucked away out of view , lounge area, spacious bedroom and outside deck . Robes provided but not slippers which would be a welcome addition . 
The main common areas are sumptuously laid out , food was excellent , gorgeous pool and outlook , lots of quirky features in and around the hotel , and loved the metal reclining sculptures. 
Loved being immersed in the local fishing community and I spent many hours watching them casting off and later bringing g in their nets and catch . 
The beach is gorgeous and really is power sand , perfect swimming conditions every morning till lunchtime , then  gets a bit choppier so back to the pool,…
Lovely staff , nothing too much trouble , a bit more urgency needed occasionally but then you think , why , what else am I going to do , so it all goes together with the laid back ambience . 
This is the only hotel on this huge sweeping bay so get there while it remains like this as sure if you  fast forward 5 years things may look a bit different,  it with 14 km of beach , there still should be plenty to go round .
Umberto the , GM , who is still in his first year has lots of plans to keep improving the place further and as he has worked in some stunning parts of the far east previously he will only improve it even more !

De plek is echt paradijselijk: geen kuststrook met het ene hotel naast het andere, opdringerige venters op het strand en mensen die 's ochtends naar hun stoeltje rennen... Nee, dit is precies het tegenovergestelde: geen enkel ander hotel in de buurt, op het strand enkel wat authentieke vissers en verdwaalde honden, en soms zelfs een slenterende koe... Heerlijk. Dit is vakantie!
Stress of drukte voel je hier simpelweg niet: het hotel was volboekt (er zijn een 15-tal kamers) en toch heb je op geen enkel moment dat gevoel. Ruimte en rust zat.

In en rond het hoofdgebouw heb je een mooie bar en een lekker restaurant, en vooral een fantastische, grote infinity pool die wel in de Indische oceaan lijkt over te lopen.

Maar wat het echt af maakt is het personeel: stuk voor stuk vriendelijke mensen die je met de glimlach bedienen, je helpen waarmee ze maar kunnen of gewoon een praatje slaan. Het komt op geen enkel moment fake over, je voelt oprechte gastvrijheid, en dat is echt fijn. En dat allemaal bovendien in prima Engels (en dat is zeker niet overal het geval in dit mooie land).

Een grote dank aan Namal, die ons continu bijstond, en aan de zeer recent aangestelde restaurantmanager (wiens naam ons even ontglipt) en zijn team.
Kortom, zeer knap wat Umberto, de manager, hier heeft neergezet op de amper negen maanden dat hij aan boord is! Proficiat, en... BEDANKT!!!

We'll be back!",Simply the best...,Karpaha Sands,-0.6671115382295773,0.4085732826900327

Достойный отель в уединенном месте, без суеты. Брали только завтраки.
Все вкусно, красиво, разнообразно. Номер с видом и на бассейн и океан, балкон - все замечтательно: просторно, чисто, хорошая косметика, уборка, полотенца, тапочки.
Отдых очень понравился и Шри-Ланка тоже. Наш отдых «сделал» водитель тук-тука Сарат +94 77 080 5223 вотс ап. Мы с ним познакомились в первый день, когда были вынуждены ехать в бентоту на шопинг (аэрофлот потерял наш чемодан) и мы были совсем без вещей. Дальше все дни он был с нами: подбирал для нас места ужина и возил нас, ждал.. всегда отменные рестораны с высоким сервисом и вкусной кухней. серф, рыбалка в океане (муж поймал дорадо и барракуду), сафари по реке, увидели все благодаря Сарату. Цены на порядок дешевле чем у оператора и все индивидуально. Плюс у него хорошее авто - ездили с ним в Эллу, на мост, водопады, мартышки … в общем организовал отдых нам на все 100 и ни разу не подвёл 👍 рекомендую.

Общий бассейн тоже отличный, с хорошим баром, музыкой и фитнесом по утрам))) Уборка номера - это что то, полотенца меняли по 3-4 раза в день!  Большое спасибо менеджеру Ольги, решала все вопросы моментально!  У отеля нет своего частного пляжа ( я так понимаю, что это везде в Шри-Ланке), но сам пляж очень чистый, океан бесподобный. Были в конце октября- начале ноября, волны большие, но плюхаться в них вполне возможно, к вечеру иногда совсем стихами. ""Следят"" за пляжем местные жители, которые за умеренную плату предложат вам шезлонг, массаж и кокос))). Там же на пляже брали экскурсии у гида Банду, он немного говорит на русском (можно торговатся). Заказывали у Банду индивидуальную рыбалку, снорклинг (потрясающе) и кормление черепах, экскурсию на черепаховую ферму, где нам разрешили за 10$ отпустить в море 2 черепашек (а ферма черепах, которая возле отеля не соглашалась ни за какие деньги). Так же каждый день через Банду заказывали тук-тук (5$ любое направление) - в ресторан, супермаркет, сувениры, аптека или куда вам надо!!

As it was our first night in Sri Lanka we requested for local fare and he (and I'd like to add the kitchen staff) went out of their way to make something special for my wife, daughter and I.

817karthikm,"My Stay at the Sheraton Kosgoda Turtle Beach Resort was spectacular. Nestled along Sri Lanka's stunning coastline, the resort offers breathtaking ocean views and a serene atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and impeccably clean, featuring modern amenities and beautiful decor. The resort's facilities including the expansive pool and spa provided ample opportunities for relaxation and recreation. 

Standout moments during my 3 Night stay included 
- A warm welcome by the staff at Reception ( Rashmi; Olga; Ishara & Sathya; Chamodi; Maleesha; Prabasara; Nipuna )
- Dining was a highlight, with a diverse breakfast buffet and delicious Mediterranean cuisine at the poolside restaurant Olive. The restaurant staff (Yadhu Shan; Kasun; Asanka; Sanjan; Chatumi; Sewwandi; Dinal; Tharindhu) were amiable and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. Dont miss the DOSA flipped over by Rashnika and Renuka at the Dosa counter in a corner. They both team up to make delicious dosa's. Please don't miss the Pancakes and Waffle counter. 

- Brilliant housekeeping team members ( Sampath; Pasan; Upeksha; Vineetha) ensured we had a comfortable stay {in both my room and my parent's rooms} catering to all our requests. Malin loads your luggage and bags with love during check-in and check-out. Book Ocean view rooms for their beautiful views of the Indian ocean. 

- Staff at the pool always had fresh towels and water bottles - which added a thoughtful touch to my experience. 

- Security staff manning the resort entrance greet you with warmth and humility; there is a couple that performs a beautiful welcome dance without tiring for all guests arriving at the resort. Their smile and happiness will energize you as you enter the property. Security staff at the beach ensure you are always safe when using the beach. Gratitude to the security staff who escorted my mother with an umbrella from the beach to the bar when it started raining. 

Special heartfelt Gratitude to F&B Director Seemon Manimel; Rashmi; Sathya; Darshi for attending to my mother when she fainted at hotel due to her diabetic health condition. Will never forget your service; kindness shown to my mother during our stay. Special thanks to the Ambulance team; Dr. Chandana Bottigama; Mr.Nanduseri (First Aid team) at the hotel for treating my mother with care. 

The Local sightseeing service provided by Lion Tours at the hotel beachfront was outstanding - Please contact Mr. Piyal and Mr.Bandhu for some amazing local tours.

Номера большие, кровать хорошая, постельное белье шикарное. Уборка номеров на отлично. 
Очень вежливый и приветливый персонал. Да при заселении возникли не большие проблемы. Но благодаря Ms Peiris все проблемы были решены. Она очень дружелюбна и заботлива к гостям. Отдельное спасибо ей за ее гостеприимство. 
В общем мы отдохнули и расслабились в этом отеле на все 100%. Это было первое наше посещение Шри Ланки. И благодаря отелю и его сотрудникам у нас в памяти остались только положительные воспоминания. Даже ежедневные дожди после обеда, не смогли нам испортить настроение. Спасибо Ширатон. 
Кто едет не на все включено, имейте ввиду, что рядом с отелем нет кафешек. Учитывайте этот факт сразу, что придется покупать еду или в отеле или прокатится на тук туке минут 20 до кафе. А то некоторые высказывали по этому поводу свои недовольства сотрудникам отеля, которые в этом не виноваты.

manthanraval,"This incident happened upon checking-in on 11/11/24, I was informed that driver accommodation was unavailable, contrary to prior confirmation of my check in via email. 

First of all, No one was at the welcome desk area, the Boat guy welcomed us at arrival. After arrival we came to know that driver’s accommodation was full in spite of our earlier check in via email. We called up front desk/reception person (who was on the other side of the water). As the main reception is at the other side of the river. We asked him for the solution in this situation or to call up on the duty manager but no revert came. We (my wife and daughter of 12) waited there for 25 mins for reception and duty manager to revert on our situation. None came forward with any solution and receptionist kept on insisting on phone to come on the other side of water where main reception & rooms are there. After waiting for around 30 minutes we went to main reception. Still duty manager was absent & the receptionist was LITRALLY LAUGHING ON US over this situation. 

He then called the duty manager, for which we requested around 40 mins back. While on call with the duty manager again he was laughing & making fun of us this entire time. 55 mins passed the arrival comes the duty manager (without wearing any badge or so. Seems to have just woke up from the sleep). We requested him to firstly handle their staff/receptionist to behave professionally which he failed to do so. Later we came up with the solution to find any nearby accommodation for the driver for which we will pay. Upon that he agreed. While all this frustrations & unpleasant situation happening THE RECEPTIONIST WAS AGAIN KEPT LAUGHING LITRALLY ON OUR FACE for don’t know why.

Key Issues: 

 1. I hv Pre-booked confirmation via mail and fulfill the online check in process still the front desk staff and duty manager behaved very much unprofessionally. 

2. Unavailability for drivers stay - Hotel claimed that the driver’s accommodation was full. So after a long tiring day, all we had to do is to again look for the driver’s accomplice & paid Rs 6600/-  to stay somewhere else. 

3. Unprofessional Staff - Receptionist Named Mr. Praboda’s attitude and behavior was totally unacceptable he was just laughing all the time. Neither did he was able to  resolve the issue nor he could offer us a glass of water. He dint explained anything like WiFi password, breakfast timing anything.

4. We were told by receptionist that Mr. Kasun - Duty Manager was roaming around the property and he came after 50 mins to meet us personally and even after listening our issue he was unable to resolve the matter. Also even after his warning & in his presence the receptionist was still laughing like he was high on drug’s. 

5. When I raised the issue to General manager Mr Silva he offered me a complementary lunch with a form where I need to sign that I will not raise the issue to trip advisor or any other platform",Excellent property with Unprofessional Receptionist and Duty Manager,Nh Bentota Ceysands Resort,2.437454958758177,-4.285672943961408

mirabella1980,"Наш с мужем 2 й визит, на момент 1го отель принадлежал другой компании.
Сравнивать не стану, тк все меняется.
Номер взяли как и в прошлое посещение с видом на реку. Мне нравится встречать рассвет, он как раз со стороны реки. И можно наблюдать как охотятся летучие лисицы.
Ремонт  был давно. Вся сантехника, кондиционер, вентилятор, выключатели работает исправно. Выдают фумитоксы, тк мы приехали в конце влажного сезона (от москитов балкон в это врем�� лучше держать закрытым). Нас опять покусали, узнав об этом дополнительно обработали номер. Территорию тоже обрабатывают.
Уборка хорошая. Красиво украшают цветами. Благодарю Kasun. 
Персонал приветливый, улыбчивый, всегда помогут, ваш это этаж или нет, в воде не откажут. Очень приятен вечерний обход: чего не хватает, что нужно дополнят.
Сотрудники трудятся в отеле по 10-15 лет. 
Питание HB. Выбор хороший, разнообразно приготовленные птица, рыба, морепродукты, свинина, спайси/и без, салаты, соусы, хлеб, выпечка и десерты. На улице готовят из яиц, любителям блинчиков стоит попробовать Hipo (яичница в корзинке из блинчика). Вечером на улице готовят пасту. Нам за две недели всегда было что выбрать.
Все внимательны к детям, помогают справиться где высоко и далеко.
У ресторана есть бассейны с рыбками, их  можно покормить. 
Благодарю персонал ресторана Cafe Bem Team: Tushara, Nissanka, Sachindu, Praveen, Sudan, Navod, Geeth, Yashodi, Sandali!(говорят по русски и учат наш язык).
Обедали по желанию в Баре у бассейна. В меню указаны цены без сервиса, учитывайте это. По субботам играет приятная живая музыка. 
Не каждый день выходит гриль с морепродуктами от ресторана 360.
Есть тайский ресторан, по предварительной записи.
Бассейны. Взрослый глубина постоянная, всем хватало в нем места и лежаков. 
Есть детский бассейн.
По выходным приезжают местные, становится шумновато, учитывайте это. Это местный закон, можете ознакомится заранее, мы знали, нас это не напрягало. Можно всегда уйти к Океану.
В бассейне работает бар с напитками.
Персонал у бассейна также внимательный к гостям.
Территория не большая, ухоженная.   Можно увидеть бурундуков, игуан, летучих лисиц. Есть SPA, магазинчики первой необходимости, ювелирный. 
Так как отель находится на косе между рекой и океаном, через реку ходит бот. Достаточно попросить на ресепшене и вас переправят.
Пляж. Чистый песчаный (да мусор присутствует, но это не избежно, Океан выбрасывает то что выбрасывают люди). Шли дожди, не затяжные, в основном утром. Вода теплая шикарная, пусть и не спокойная. Людей не пугает. Закаты очень красивые. В сезон говорят становится меньше волн.  
На пляже работают местные ребята, с Кумаре и Романом (говорят на русском) можно ехать по ближайшим  местам в поселке, а так же на экскурсии.  Знают места которые хотят посмотреть туристы, по дороге останавливаются где попросишь.
Вдоль берега проезжает на тук-туке местный художник, взяла его картину.
Сердечно благодарю💚🙏🏻:
Roshini менеджер ресторана и бара за ее внимательное отношение, содействие и участие в том чтобы наш отдых был комфортным. И конечно за завершающий отдых ужин, за комплимент специально приготовленный для нас.

Шеф Повара, свою благодарность выразила ему лично. За разнообразное вкусное меню предусмотренное для всех народностей, а их в отеле собирается много (русские, англичане, немцы, французы, индийцы, шриланкийцы, китайцы и др). Сам смотрит за залом, его не возможно не заметить.

PeterD8,"This was the final hotel on our Trip a Deal Tour where we stayed for 2 nights. 
First impression was that the property was well spread out over the site. The room was a big size and very clean. We had a great view of the pool and was only about 30m from the beach.
Location was a bit isolated (part of the charm) with food options outside the resort for dinner (or lunch for that matter) requiring a boat ride across the river to the main town.
Food at the hotel was excellent with a range of choices at various prices. We ate the buffet for dinner one night and it had the largest range we saw on the trip. 
Breakfast was also good with a wide variety to choose from and replenished regularly.
Would be more than happy to spend a week here - it was very relaxing.",Right on the Beach - A quality experience,Nh Bentota Ceysands Resort,2.437454958758177,-0.7649882739728273

On arrival it was a big pleasant surprise to meet the General Manager if the property Mr. Wim Fagel who had many improvements to this wonderful property over the years. 

It's right royal welcome from the beginning with welcome drink and pleasant faces around makes you to forget that there is an outside world. Happy to meet the ever smiling curtius Front Office Manager Mr. Tharanga Wimalaratna too. 

The long stretching beach and pool takes the time without us realising it. The food here is absolutely delicious! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.

The service was top-notch. Happy to see many Freshers are getting into the trade - who are very attentive and prompt - which hotel industry needs at the moment.

BernieCMD,"Lieu vraiment idéal pour passer de belles et bonnes vacances, au calme situé à l’écart de la ville sur la péninsule entre la rivière Bentota et l’Océan Indien et bordé par une superbe plage de sable fin.

Un très bel établissement bien et efficacement agencé autour de sa réception. Des chambres boisées très confortables et bien équipées. Et, par ailleurs et surtout, un personnel toujours extraordinaire de gentillesse, souriant, disponible et bienveillant.

Pardon à chaque fois à ceux que nous aurions oubliés de mentionner. Cela n’enlève rien à vos qualités humaines et professionnelles indéniables.

Un grand restaurant,  2 restaurants à thème, un ""poissons & fruits de mer et l'autre, Thaï. 

Le restaurant, le « Café Bem », très joliment et chaleureusement décoré, couleur ""brasserie"", avec une grande terrasse donnant sur la rivière. 

Il propose une cuisine locale et internationale, avec chaque soir du lundi ou jeudi, un thème différent avec les dîners/buffets indiens, chinois, italiens et mexicain. Le choix est toujours très large, il y en a pour tous les goûts. Et quel que soit le jour ou le repas, tout est toujours excellent. Nous nous sommes sincèrement régalés chaque fois. 

Sous la direction du grand Chef Bernard Jayasuriya, une équipe de chefs de cuisine, de chefs, de cuisiniers, d’apprentis, dynamiques, qui donnent chaque jour le meilleur d’eux-mêmes, de concert avec tous les chefs de rang et serveurs, pour faire de chaque repas un moment des plus privilégiés et des plus délicieux à tous égards.

Côté cuisine, nous ne pourrons citer tout le monde car, par souci d’hygiène, l’équipe ne porte pas de badge. Un grand, grand merci et aussi un grand, grand bravo à toute l’équipe sans aucune exception pour leur professionnalisme, leur disponibilité et leurs sourires quotidiens. Nous saluons parmi eux, sans rien enlever à chacun, S.H. de Silva, Christopher, Niyomi, Maduwe, Shirumi, Anurhada, Himaya…

Côté salle, une équipe aussi dynamique, efficace et adorable. Après quelques jours au restaurant, nous nous sentions comme en famille, chacun connaissant nos goûts, nos préférences, nos allergies... Génial !  Ils nous ont accompagnés chaque fois avec attention et prévenance : Sandali, Sashini, Rasika, Sachindu, Thushara, Praveen, Tanusha, Sudan, Chamith, Rachita, Nissanka, Lalantha, Tharanga, Geeth, Thanuka, Suranjih, Navod, Yashodi, Vinuka, Nadeeka, Maheshani…

Côté bar, quelques pauses agréables et toujours en  bonne compagnie au ""Ceylon Club Bar"" avec Uditha, Madusanka, Shehan, Madu, Wasantha, Sithu… N’étant pas adeptes de la piscine, nous n’avons testé son bar.

Au quotidien également, une équipe de ménage exceptionnelle et efficace. Discrets mais très professionnels, chacun est un artiste et poète à sa manière, composant de très beaux motifs de fleurs et de feuilles sur le lit, et de jolis petits bouquets aux parfums subtils. Merci beaucoup à Nuwan, Nishanta, encore plus discret mais adorable Dumindu, et aussi Samihira, Priyanta, Sujeewa… N’oubliant pas non plus les agents d’entretien, très discrets aussi mais veillant à chaque instant à la propreté de l’hôtel, dont Samihara, Nussanta… 

Toujours disponibles chacun leur tour, 24/24, les bateliers dont Ruwan & Supun et leurs collègues.

Également toujours très présents et aidant à la réception, entre autres, Tharanga, Hansini, Lithara. Les Bell boys, souriants et prévenants à chaque instant, Russel, Adil, Chananka, Sripal…

Et finalement, tous les gardes veillant à la sécurité de l’hôtel jour et nuit.

_J6920JZ,"Были с дочерью с 03.10.2024
Отель расположен на берегу Индийского океана! В номерах чисто, есть кондиционер, чайник с чаем и кофе, халаты, тапки, сейф, фен! Убирались по графику. На ресепшене персонал приветливый! 
В ресторане еда разнообразная: мясо, рыба, курица, овощи, фрукты - голодными не ходили! 
ТОЛЬКО НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ ПОКУПАТЬ ЭКСКУРСИИ У ОТЕЛЬНЫХ ГИДОВ - ООООЧЕНЬ ДОРОГО!!!!
Мы покупали экскурсии у Марли, (фото приложу) он всегда на берегу океана или подходит его команда рекламировать туры! В чем его плюсы:
1. Цена
2. Безопасность (возил нас группой из 8 человек из нашего отеля на своем новом минивэне, где работал кондиционер, НЕ ТО ЧТО АВТОБУСЫ С АЭРОПОРТА 🙄)
3. Отлично владеет русским языком, оказалось он знает 5 языков и был в Москве 
4. Во время экскурсий, всё рассказывал на русском языке, отвечал на наши вопросы (есть с кем сравнить, был гид, который молчал во время экскурсий и спрашивается зачем платить за молчание..)
5. И вишенка на торте 🍒 в конце экскурсии Марли (Marley) организовал нашей команде из 8 человек ужин на берегу океана возле нашего отеля, там есть типо мини веранды. Были супер вкусно приготовленные 🍤 креветки и рыба Дорада 👍 Кола и 🍷, мы ели, пили, фоткались, в нашу честь группа Marley его брат Ранга пускали фейерверки 🎆 были супер эмоции!

garvielll,"Всем доброго времени суток
Отдыхали с супругой в данном отеле с 03.10 по 11.10

Отзыв хочу разделить на несколько частей:

1. Сам отель
Отель хороший, достаточно большой по территории, много проходов, прикрытых крышей (что позволяет ходить сухим в любой дождь, а они тут бывают), немного запутанная логистика, но с 1 дня в принципе достаточно легко ориентироваться). Невероятно красивая территория, много открытых площадок (любили вечером сидеть под открытым небом с океанским бризом в баре)
Тут смело 5

2. Комнаты
Тут как повезет, ребят
Мы жили в 2 комнатах и это было сильно контрастно.
Сначала нас заселили в комнату 3020 (ground floor), где не было фена, была большая влажность (за сутки не сохли полотенца) и не работал адекватно кондиционер.
Благо персонал оперативно реагирует и пытается чинить с моменте.
После жили в 1204 (2 floor) - вот это райское место. Сухая чистая комната, хорошо сделанный туалет, адекватно работающий кондей, солнечная сторона. Тут все было замечательно.
Итог - 4, но только за комнату 1204.

3. Столовая, пляж и бары

3.1 Начнем с ресторанов) Их на территории 3)
И даже если у вас all inclusive - для вас бесплатно будет доступен только один (cafe bem) 
Остальные 2 - тайский и рыбный - платные при любом раскладе)
Но не все так плохо)
В ресторане, который предоставляет сам отель работают невероятно отзывчивые и приятные ребята:
- Sandali (Мы очень много с ней разговаривали, невероятный человек)
- Sachindu
- Nissanka
- Chamith
- Praveen
- Latantha
Каждый из этих ребят поможет вам с выбором, проконсультирует, может рассказать интересную историю, если вы попросите))
Меню ресторана (несмотря на то что ездили мы в межсезонье) - обширное, что замечательно - разнообразное и не острое) Есть тематические ужины и сотрудники будут одеты в соответствующую одежду)
Тут 5 смело

3.2 Бары
Их 2, один в бассейне (мы им не пользовались), другой - Ceylon club bar. Тут тоже работают отзывчивые и оперативные ребята(Madusanka, Nipuna)) 
Большой им респект)
Тут тоже 5

3.3 Пляж
Сам по себе пляж чистый, но нет лежаков, полотенца выдают только на территории отеля в бассейне, на пляж с ними нельзя) Также нельзя на пляж с коктейлями
Тут 5 из 5, мне не так нужны были лежаки, сколько нужен был прекрасный чистый пляж)

4. Персонал
Я уже много отметил в других категориях людей, но отдельно выделю 2 типа персонала.
1 - Это 98% всего персонала отеля. Они - замечательные, будут с вами здороваться, улыбаться, с любой проблемой помогут как смогут.
2 - Это 1 человек, который чуть не испортил нам отдых.
Ситуация была в комнате 3020.
07.10. У нас вечером были выключены все кондиционеры и вентилятор, ибо началась акклиматизация.
В номере стояла высокая влажность и сработала пожарная сигнализация.
В 1 раз пришли очень вежливые ребята из обслуживающего персонала с охранником, вежливо спросили можно ли им войти, а также уточнили, курим ли мы в номере. На отрицательный ответ отреагировали адекватно, извинились и ушли.
Во 2 раз случилась комедия в 2 актах. Я ушел в душ (напоминаю, ездили вдвоем с супругой), в какой то момент услышал как нашу дверь не то чтобы пинают, а чуть не выламывают. Накинув полотенце на себя, вылетел из душа и наблюдаю картину как в номере стоит 4 человека и большой жирный мужик просто орет на мою жену. На закономерный вопрос ""какого хрена тут происходит"" этот товарищ начинает орать на меня на ломаном английском, с сутью претензий - вы курите в номере. На закономерный ответ - нет, не курим - он продолжает орать. Я неплохо знаю английский, но когда этот товарищ не понимает меня - я как и любой другой человек перехожу на родной язык. На что жирный боров снова орет на меня, что я должен разговаривать с ним на английском, который он не понимает. 
Все решилось тем, что этот мужик сказал, что впаяет нам штраф 1000 долларов если еще раз сработает сигнализация, хлопнул дверью и ушел. Я, в свою очередь, уточнил у персонала кто это. Оказалось что это general manager отеля. Так закончился 1 акт.
Второй акт был еще смешнее. Мы ушли на океан, отсутствовали несколько часов. Когда же пришли в номер - увидели что дверь нараспашку, там находятся сотрудники отеля, которые пытаются чинить эту дурацкую сигнализацию. 
В номере, где нет нас и у нас тут лежат личные вещи (телефоны, планшеты, деньги, паспорта).
Мы просто психанули, пришли на ресепшен и потребовали замену номера. И слава богу что тут работали адекватные девушки, которые решили вопрос за час. Вот так мы переехали в номер 1204. Где все было хорошо.
Так вот, напишу ремарку специально для general manager.
1. Никто из персонала НЕ ИМЕЕТ ПРАВА повышать голос на клиента.
2. НИКТО, НА КАКОЙ БЫ ОН ДОЛЖНОСТИ НЕ БЫЛ - не имеет права требовать от клиента доказывать свою невиновность.
3. Угрозы в адрес клиента - это overhead.
4. Умение понимать международный язык - это только половина успеха, не можете говорить на английском - заведите себе человека, который будет у вас работать переводчиком.

Итого:
- Обслуживание со стороны отеля - 5 баллов
- Адекватность general manager - 0 баллов
Разберитесь с вашим управляющим персоналом, господа. 
Главный менеджер - это лицо отеля. А этот товарищ показывает ваш отель в самом что ни на есть отвратительном свете. 
Решайте, что для вас важнее. Пока что - это отвратительный сервис.

5. Неземное удовольствие.
Да да, именно так)
Я не могу по другому назвать человека, который со своей командой сделал нам этот отпуск незабываемым!
Marley Tour. Марли и Ранга. Все ребята)
Спасибо Вам всем большое! Вы самые лучшие!
Если Вы, читающий этот отзыв, думаете чем же заняться - просто приходите к Марли)
Любые экскурсии, отличный русский, замечательная компания, шутки, приколы и конечно Специальные программы - это все ребята))
Очень интересно, весело, легко и с большим количеством юмора)

The cold soup was inedible, and the bufet had shockingly few options. The naan was dry and unappetizing, and the pizza? Just as bad—dry and lacking any flavor whatsoever.

Sheriden13,"This is not a five star hotel!  We booked a junior suite for our three night stay which was very comfortable and would recommend.
Upon arrival the checking in process was average and towards the end I had to go and confirm the  process had been completed. It felt we were left stranded. Not even shown where the lifts were located.
You are only issued with one key card and a third time used key card holder. Masking fluid had been used to remove the previous room number! ( this was a cardboard key card holder). You had to return both at the end of your stay otherwise according to the guest information book in the room there would be a 20 USD charge for lost cards.  I find it unbelievable you are issued with a used key card holder and incur a possible charge.
The food was very good, however, if you would like a bottle of wine with dinner, only the most expensive wines were available throughout our stay which reduced the wine menu  significantly . No apology was given from anyone when attempting to order  the wine. 
There is a small swimming pool with only eight sun beds available. However, it seemed to work. 
We had a driver from the hotel who took us around Kandy for the day and very informative regarding the sights and made sure we were dropped as close as possible and agreed a pickup time. A big shout out for excellent service.

jvmnrw,"Whilst on a tour of Sri Lanka my friend and I  stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. 
We found the food to be extremely disappointing. Whilst the display looked inviting actually trying to eat the food proved to be quite a challenge. Almost without exception the food was either cold and then put onto cold plates or had been left under the lights and completely dried out. 
I wasn’t prepared to complain but the restaurant manager came and asked us if everything was okay. We told him of our concerns and he brought out the sous chef. The main chef was on holiday. 
He and I walked around the buffet and I pointed out the issues I had. He was in total agreement. 
I also explained that the boiled eggs at breakfast were cooked until virtually black inside. The next morning without ordering 2 boiled eggs arrived on the table and they were virtually raw. 
On  the first night my friend and I went to bed at 21.30 hr as we had had a long tiring day travelling. The guests in the next door room were having a party / rave and had their room door open. The noise was unbearable. My friend phoned reception and asked them to address the issue. A lovely young man came up and asked them to close their door. Obviously the noise was then concentrated in our room. 
I phoned reception and was told it would be passed to the duty manager. Some time later we heard a knock at the door of the room next door and subsequently the music was turned down. Some time later the duty manager spoke to my friend on the phone and said we could recontact him if there were further problems. 
The people then moved to the room on the other side of ours and began again. We decided not to recontact the reception and it stopped at 23.30 hours. 
On mentioning this on checking out the receptionist just shrugged her shoulders.

This is no fault of the hotel but this needs to be addressed as I would definitely not return here or recommend because of this which is a shame as the location is great.
We had a beautiful meal on the beach last night and the staff are friendly but no sleep is not the one.
There is no one to report this too so literally have just had to put up with it.

Location was excellent and staff was friendly. 
Room was spacious with a balcony and bathroom was quite spacious as well to my surprise. 

Things to improve in my point of view being a hotelier my self for fresh wave would be... to have room checks before giving out the room - tv did not work it didn’t worry us too much cause we were out,  Hot water did not work it did not bother us to much cause we are local, the bathroom and it’s equipment could be cleaned and kept better,  breakfast could be don’t better add Sri Lankan breakfast add a meat item it will be better.

Unfortunately we were there at Xmas though and the dueling hotels blasting their techno music led to an incredibly loud, sleepless night. The noise was so bad that our windows rattled constantly. It was insane. Staff noted that it’s only that bad at Xmas and New Years but I would worry about weekends as well given it seems to be a party town. Our other complaint would be the lack of hot water which we feel should be a given at that price. ",Mixed bag ,Fresh Wave Mirissa,-0.916195218445647,-1.9385498306356874

We arrived at the hotel and the reception guy was not there.

Bed was dirty, closet doors were broken, safe doesn't work, they did not gave us towels, there's no phone in the room (even if they say this hotel has a room service), even if we went down at 9.50 pm, they did not let us eat dinner, they didn't have hairdryer too and the fridge was completely empty. We cancelled our reservation and, even if we showed them some pictures to motivate our decision, they charge us the amount. So we paid two times: booking.com cancellation price plus staying price. Even If we paid for breakfast, there were extra money to pay to have an orange juice glass... an hotel like this must have maximum 2 stars, IT WAS absolutely NOT 4 STARS HOTEL! TAKE CARE ABOUT FEEDBACKS, BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE DONE BY SRILANKAN CITIZENS OR YOUNG BACKPACKERS. I WAS TRAVELLING WITH MY BOYFRIEND. THE ONLY THING WHICH IS GOOD WAS THE BEACH, AND THAT'S IT.

However, we were not as impressed with the reception staff. They charged us for three people but refused to give a third key. One of the receptionist was particularly rude and condescending. He didn’t realize I speak the language and asked the other receptionist to tell me it costs $20 for the third key! When I spoke in Sinhala, he tried to show the back of the key that said “ $20 charge will be added to the bill for all lost keys” !! And nothing about extra charges for extra keys! When I pointed I haven’t lost any key, the second receptionist apologetically  told  that they are out of keys, which was perfectly fine with me. Just tell me the truth!

The food is really good. The buffets have everything you want at breakfast and dinner. The staff is incredibly friendly and take care of you. Especially our server Ajith was wonderful.

heena0902,"During our visit to Sri Lanka, we stayed at The Golden Crown Hotel for just one night on August 2nd. Unfortunately, our experience was marred by a serious issue. After checking in around 6:30 pm, we settled into our room and left to explore the hotel. Later that night, before going to bed, I realized that $200 was missing from my wallet. Initially, I thought I might have misplaced it, so I gave the remaining money to my husband, who counted it and stored it in his wallet, which he then placed in his backpack instead of the room’s safe.

The next morning, after spending about an hour at the pool, my husband checked the money again and found that we were now missing another $100. It became clear that someone had entered our room during our absence and taken the money. We immediately reported the incident to the receptionist. Despite not requesting any cleaning services, when hotel management reviewed the security footage, it showed a cleaner entering our room after we had left for the pool, staying for more than a minute, and leaving without cleaning anything. When questioned, the cleaner claimed he was checking for an electricity issue, which we had never reported.

I was shocked to learn that hotel staff are allowed to enter guests' rooms without their request. The general manager’s explanation that it is standard policy for cleaners to check rooms did little to alleviate our concerns. We were deeply disappointed by the handling of this situation.

While I don't want this incident to tarnish the hotel’s overall reputation, I strongly advise future guests to be vigilant about their belongings and use the in-room safe at all times. Unfortunately, it seems that both the cleaning staff and upper management cannot be fully trusted at this hotel.",I strongly advise future guests to be vigilant about their belongings and use the in-room safe at all times.,The Golden Crown Hotel,0.1285507506110973,-4.285672943961408

K166DJrichards,"My wife and son spent a week in Sri Lanka for our 15th anniversary.  Itravel quite a bit for work so I'm used to hotels but I have to say that this is one of the nicest Marriott properties that I'd stayed  in.  The pool is humongous and the property is right on the beach.

While we were staying at the hotel, we met Sarah Darmabandu, who operates a turtle hatchery next to the hotel.  ""Bandu"" is also a licensed tour operator who set up a couple tours for us.  These tours were a river boat ride to see crocodiles and we also got to feed wild monkeys by hand.  We ate at great restaurant on the river, went to a large buddhist temple, went to multiple local souvenir shops, and were treated 1st class the whole time.  

Bandu also arranged for us to go snorkeling in the ocean with 2 instructors and were able to feed crackees to the fish by hand, took us to a different beach where we got swim with and feed large sea turtles, went to the 2004 Tsunami museum, saw a moonstone mine, and went to a large sea turtle conservatory, where my wife and son got to release baby sea turtles into the ocea.

We had also booked a couple tours to Yala National Park and other spots through ""Get Your Guide"" online which were fine, but much more expensive than Bandu's prices.  I definitely would have arranged everything through Bandu if I had known about him at the time.

I highly recommend Sheraton Turtle Beach Hotel and also recommend reaching out to Bandu on WhatsApp to organize any safaris or tours you want to do.  He's 3/4 of the cost, has amazing service, and will save you a couple hundred dollars of the course of a week.

_T9352EI,"Всем доброго дня! В этом году решили провести свой отпуск (с 20/10.24по 2/11.24) на Шри ланке и ничуть не пожалели. Очень колоритная страна с добрыми и улыбчивыми жителями. Мы из  тех путешественников, которые не ищут недостатки, а наслаждаются отдыхом здесь и сейчас. Отдельный респект Аэрофлоту-долетели шикарно: закормили и запоили на протяжении всего полёта.
Отель  выбирали по отзывам, остановились на The Palms, не пожалели. Небольшая, но уютная зелёная территория с весёлыми бурундучками, которые целый день веселятся среди лежаков и пальм. Номер 3316,самый обычный, регулярная уборка и пополнение принадлежностей . Русскоговорящий парень Анушка на ресепшене всегда интересовался нашим отдыхом. С ланч боксами для экскурсий никогда не подводил.
По поводу еды: да, скудно ,ассортимент блюд в основном перчено-переперчено, остро, но найти можно. Догонялись сладостями, фруктами и мороженым.
Океан шикарен, во второй половине октября немного штормило, но это только добавляло шарма в наш заплыв, без волн было-бы скучно). Как и писали в отзывах ниже, рядом есть спокойная лагуна.
По поводу экскурсий: читали в отзывах про местного, разрекламированного русскоговорящего гида Индико, по прилёту думала связаться с ним ,пообщаться и понять не реклама ли этот Индико. Но в первый день на пляже к нам подошёл Иса(+94 76 616 3652), он так же хорошо владеет  русским языком и как-то всё сложилось само-собой, он представил нас Индико. Решили взять у него одну экскурсию в центр острова: Элла, малый пик Адама, девятиарочный мост ,водопады и т.д. Ездили на комфортабельном авто. Нам очень понравилось и мы забронировали Индико на все две недели нашего отпуска. Подтверждаю: порядочный, доброжелательный человек, уважающий туристов, никуда не торопит, фотографирует(по просьбе),всегда рядом.(+94 77 540 7274) В город Иса и Индико возят бесплатно на Тук-Туке и ждут сколько нам надо время сделать покупки(сувениры, чай и т.д.) Справа от отеля на острове в океане стоит маяк, так вот Индико, по нашей просьбе  организовал нам туда экскурсию на лодке.

I spend at the property 2 night and I enjoyed it a lot. The room was amazing clean and tide. For the foods there was so many variety of foods and desserts. The receptionist who is checked me in Avindu was so nice and he even bother to lead me to the room.  Not only him but all the staff was so nice and friendly.

jakehS2092JV,"Sea shell horns and rhythmic drums worthy of any royal arrival welcome you to the Golden Crown.  The welcome party invite you in to the grand lobby which rivals any palatial residence.

The sophisticated reception is decorated with stone style tiles, deep timbers, a palatial chandelier and art, vases and flowers. This contrasts with the deep green jungle which is visible through floor to ceiling windows.

This hotel exudes luxury.

The staff are friendly and attentive however the hospitality skills were unable to meet the expectations set by the grandeur of the building. On one occasion at the ""TREATS"" cafe we asked to look at the menu. When we asked for an Afforgato the staff member looked confused and unsure what the menu item was, they asked us to take a seat. They didn't return.
On a second occasion we asked for an Iced Long Black (Americano), we received a hot Long Black (Americano) and when we tried to explain iced the staff brought out an ice bucket and tried to place the cup inside to cool. Finally we managed to get a glass and we placed our own ice in and poured the warm coffee in. It was a learning experience for us and the staff and we were disarmed by their cheerful and humble disposition.

The ""BRIX"" restaurant buffet was adequate and provided a huge range. The food was flavoursome, however any cooked meats (roasts) outside of a curry were over cooked and dry. The wait staff would walk off without providing direction to customers and constantly allocated the wrong costs to the wrong rooms after multiple explanations. This was a low point of the service, although consummate with an apprentice level skill it seems to be caused by a language barrier, staff were constantly smiling and friendly.

The rooms were exceptional and comfortable. Roomy, soft beds, great bathrooms and comfortable air-conditioning. The gym and spa were exceptional, and there was a pool table, and foosball table for recreational use. We used the laundry service which was great. 

The infinity pool had a great view but was small and uncomfortably cold. The service around the pool was good.

All in all a great hotel which would be fantastic if the service and food matched the grandeur of the facilities and rooms.",Crowned Grandeur and Luxury only to be let down by substandard service and food.,The Golden Crown Hotel,0.1285507506110973,-0.7649882739728273

However, our experience with the reception staff was disappointing. Despite extending our stay by one night and settling the payment at the reception, we faced repeated requests to pay for extras that we had already paid for. This inconsistency in billing procedures detracted from an otherwise enjoyable stay.
Overall, Golden Crown Hotel provided a luxurious and comfortable retreat, marred only by the issues with billing at the reception.

_S5658FP,"Добрый день! Отдыхали в этом отеле с 25.09.24 по 03.10.24 вдвоем с мужем. Что хочу сказать, очень приятные, номера просторные и большие, удобная кровать, хороший, не обшарпанный ремонт. В каждом номере балкон. 
Персонал убирает 2 раза в день. Реально убирают! Даже зарядку для телефона и вещи твои складывают. Нам делали очень красивые штучки из полотенец и цветов на кровати😍 Оставляли шоколадки и немножко на чай.
Мы брали all inclusive, завтраки отдельная любовь: невероятная сдоба, как в наших пекарнях, всегда есть яйца, свежие фрукты (ананасы пушка), йогурты, достойный кофе, много хлеба и даже овсяная каша. 
На обед вкусная рыба и морепродукты, рис, много местной кухни, иногда обеды были по меню. Ужины часто тематические. Нам особенно полюбились ужины итальянской кухни. 
Территория тоже очень красивая и живописная, отель с одной стороны опоясывает река. Бегают бурундуки, вараны и игуаны. Большой, хоть и мелкий бассейн. Достаточно лежаков.
До пляжа идти минуту. Он общественный. Невероятный океан в этом месте, как с лучших картинок. Пологий вход. Ни одного камешка. Идеально! Коса широчайшая, можно купаться у любого отеля.  Очень теплый океан.
Теперь по погоде. Нас пугали несезоном, но по факту дождь был кратковременным, ни разу он не сломал наших планов. В океане купались каждый день, но надо понимать, что далеко тут все равно не заплывешь. Народу было немного, не было дикого пекла и мы комфортно передвигались днем, а не сидели в номере под кондером. Зимой местные говорят лежак у бассейна не занять, отель битком, и дикая жара.
Отдельно хочу отметить персонал, который старался для нас каждый день в ресторане, а это: Sachindu, Thanusha, Sandali, Rachitha, Tharanga, Geeth и невероятно улыбчивая девушка Shashini (надеюсь, правильно), а также ребят из бара у бассейна!

Экскурсии мы не стали брать у гида , потому что цена была завышена , чем у Марли на пляже . Это что то с чем то даже в шоке . Мы брали экскурсию на Эллу , водопад Равана , поездка на поезде -очень крутые фотки там делали , девятиарочный мост , малый пик Адама . В подарок нам Марли сделал поездку на тук туке по городу и прогулка по реке Бентота. Кормили обезьян , держали крокодильчика на руках. 
Ездили еще на ферму черепах, кормили их . Такая милота . Запускали маленьких черепашек . Также ребята Марли нас сопровождали по городу на тук туках когда ездили за сувенирами , помогали выбрать фрукты чтобы перевезти домой . Сними ни так страшно было передвигаться именно по городу в плане что выхватят вещи из рук. Самое запоминающее что такого ни когда не делал -это ужин на пляже с креветками , напитками , костром и салютом . Вот честно это самый незабываемый отпуск . Марли сделал его крутым , просто всем рекомендуем . Также нам повезло что познакомились с компанией и мы все вместе 8человек везде передвигались .

lana1212017,"Отдыхали вместе с муже в этом отеле в сентябре 2024 года. Номер у нас был с красивым видом на реку на 3 этаже, в номере было очень уютно  ежедневная уборка номера  была идеальная, всегда чисто и пахло гвоздикой, живые цветы в вазе и на кровати, свежие полотенца в ванной (отдельное спасибо уборщику Sugath). Но есть один нюанс в номер проникали насекомые (видимо москиты) и очень сильно нас искусали, Фумитокс на них не действовал. Укусы очень зудели и чесались и по приезду в Москву. Рекомендую не открывать дверь на лоджию при электрическом свете.
 Питание в отеле хорошее, особенно завтраки. Блюда можно спокойно выбрать, очередей за блюдом на шведском столе не было никогда. Сервис в ресторане прекрасный, метрдотель  Sandali всегда встречала с улыбкой и провожала к  понравившемуся столику. Официанты обслуживали любезно и быстро приносили очень вкусные свежевыжатые соки, особенно хочется отметить Thushara, Sachindu, Nissanka Sudana, Chamith.Около бассейна лежаков и зонтиков всегда хватало, пляжные полотенца были свежие и чистые.(Хотя на сайте туроператора Библиоглобус было заявлено что пляжные полотенца отель не предоставляет). 
В океане всегда были волны, плавать в океане не возможно только прыгать и кататься на волнах. Пляж возле отеля с мелким желтым песком очень впечатлил. Спасатели этого отеля отлично работали, всегда зорко смотрели за туристами и неоднократно в течение нашего отдыха спасали ретивых туристов которые видимо первый раз увидели океан.  Мы часто ездили на экскурсии и с отельным гидом и с уличным гидом Димушем, все экскурсии понравились, флора и фауна в Шри Ланке потрясающая!

The front of your room faces the lagoon while the back door of your room opens to a swimming pool. Beside this is the prestine beach with lots of water sports. My kid spent most of the time in the pool. Rooms were comfortable and the buffet spread sumptuous. The 1st day Indian veg food was limited, the next day they uped the ante with more veg options. Service by the staff is brilliant, they make you feel comfortable. I found a cockroach and a fly in the hooper, this was becz the kitchen was open. The next day it was fine. Boat service is available 24/7. Spa looked luxurious, didn't have time to use it though. There is a kids play area where I played football with my son. They also have a kids club where my son was painting. They took good care of him while I walked around the property. I was looking forward to the yoga session but they cancelled due to limited crowd which was disappointing.

The food was really nice with good variaty every day. It was always hot and fresh - the chefs were on top of their game.

There was plenty of room around the massive pool, no problem with getting a sunbed (although it was out of season so the hotel wasn't full)

There is a short (less than 5 mins) boat ride to the resort. Check in was very efficient and we were gifted with a free upgrade to the junior suite - an amazing room/apartment with a beautiful sea view! Our room attendant Nuwan introduced himself to us and was always on hand if we needed anything and greeted us every morning, asking about our day. Nuwan brought a smile to our faces every day as he decorated the bed with different creative designs and we were both touched by the thoughtfulness, making our stay extra special. Our favourite was the crocodile, garnished with the sunglasses!! There was a great variety of meal options (especially for vegetarian), beautiful and clean facilities - including the pool, gym and spa, and quick access to the beach for stunning sunset views. The beach isn't private, but it felt it due to the resort's location and long stretching beaches. They offer free WiFi throughout the resort which is quick and we were able to stream films with ease.

Брали 2 экскурсии у Марли, (за забором слева +94 71 095 2005), рекомендую. У нас была 2-х часовая прогулка по реке Бентота, кормили обезьян, встретили варанов, много разных птиц. Вторая экскурсия была на целый день, была маленькая группа из 5 человек: водопад Равана, девятиарочный мост в Элле, малый пик Адама и Сафари. Также Марли организовал нам ужин на берегу океана, приготовил вкуснейшие креветки. Помог нам обменять рубли на рупии.

ootopcat,"The negatives below were balanced by good location on the beach, fair breakfast, and decent size room I slept well in. Overall, a host of reasons made this my worst experience in Sri Lanka, when as supposedly 4 stars, I’d hoped it would be the best.
- treated with suspicion on arrival, asked to prove I had booked
- asked to pay upfront
- tried to charge me an extra $5; only when I queried it did the employee change the 8 to a 3 on the bill wordlessly, no apology
- no toilet paper in the bathroom
- when I couldn’t get attention of a server I went and asked for a drink at the bar then pointed to where I was sitting. The guy said ok but no drink came (I went to the place next door instead)
This was the only time the above things happened to me in Sri Lanka.
- leaking bidet hose meant constantly water all over bathroom floor
- if you don’t go for a room with sea-view, be warned you’re close to the constantly-noisy road
- very thin curtains so room bright after sunrise 
- TV on wall but no remote control",Decent place but with shortfalls,Fresh Wave Mirissa,-0.916195218445647,-1.9385498306356874

But one thing that stands out at this hotel is the love and kindness of all the staff at this hotel.
One person who has really shone in our opinion is Madushanki, at the Reception, who has gone out if her way to make sure that we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and make our 30th Wedding anniversary,  extra special. She's a gem of a young lady,  always with a lovely smile on her face 💕 
Other staff that are worth mentioning are Saranga, the Pool Man and Thakshila in the restaurant. 
If you go to the beach and you go to the left, you come across a good gentleman, who can arrange anything for you such as Massages, a trip with the Tuk Tuk to the nearby town or organise a trip to the Turtle Sanctuary 🐢, followed by a visit to a Private Moonstone Mine, all done within a few hours. 
Change your currency in town.  You get a much better rate of exchange.  I wouldn't hesitate to go to the Palms hotel again. 
They even organised a special dinner for two to make our 30th Wedding anniversary extra special . It was worth every penny.  Highly recommended.

Das Personal im Restaurant z.B. Herr Chamara und an der Bar ist sehr positiv zu erwähnen.
Ausflüge :
Mit unseren Touren haben wir uns schon von zu Hause aus befasst und uns ist immer wieder der Name Sunil Silva positiv aufgefallen. man geht zum Strand, linke Seite und fragt nach Sunil. er spricht gut Deutsch. wir haben drei Ausflüge mit Sunil unternommen und waren begeistert wie alles super geklappt hat! Waren immer zur rechten Zeit vor Ort ( z.B. Zugfahrt, Teeplantagen,Jala Nationalpark und Elefantenwaisenhaus) um die Höhepunkte nicht zu verpassen. 
man kann Sunil blind vertrauen ! Alle Fahrten nur mit uns und im klimatisiertem Auto.
Wir wünschen ihm immer viele Touristen!",ein gelunener Urlaub,The Palms,0.5127174298158194,0.4085732826900327

tess1000,"We stayed here for four nights on an all inclusive basis after travelling in Sri Lanka. It was the perfect base for some much needed downtime.

The children loved the pool area and also the water sports the hotel offered.  I particularly loved the river safari - definitely worth doing if you can.  We saw such amazing wildlife and scenery, just a short distance away from the hotel.  Crocodile, monkeys, water monitors, bats and more! 

The service in the restaurant was wonderful and the food absolutely delicious- I miss the curries! 

On our last night the staff made the dining table so beautiful for us and taught our children how to fold napkins, it was really special.  

Thank you to everyone who made our stay amazing including Chamith, Thashara, Nishanka and Shaghini.  I had more names to remember, but I can’t find them so sorry!  But  everyone was amazing and treated us so well. 

The rooms were left beautifully clean and with such pretty flowers and towel animals everyday! 

Also the service around the pool area and pool bar was brilliant. 

I hope I have remembered everyone!

247kellil,"The most wonderful thing about this hotel is the staff - they could not do enough to help and look after us, from helping with luggage, setting up chairs at the pool, organising drinks and explaining food.

The food was of high standard and delicious, and especially the desserts. The pastry chef was fantastic.

The rooms were lovely with high ceilings and good aircon. The only issue I had was being a bit cold at night with only a single sheet on the bed. Bathrooms were clean.

The pool was lovely to spend time in and around. Sunsets spectacular from the beach. 

The only negatives:

- the wifi didn’t work at all
- the spa has a musty smell in the rooms
- on my last morning someone from housekeeping rushed into my room to check the bar fridge and move things around, well before checkout time. This made me feel very y comfortable.

125nedl,"We had an unfortunate stay at Mandara, mostly due to ongoing construction noise and being lied to by all levels of management staff. The first room we were brought to, was refused,  due to the poor size and facilities, not being like the advertised pictures, the second room was slightly better, but is in need of some maintenance and has mold everywhere. We were nearing the end of a fabulous 3 week stay in Sri Lanka, and this hotel was the worst of all the places we stayed. If we had been told the truth about construction noise next door to our unit, we would have changed hotels like other families did staying at the same time. Instead, we were promised many things, lied to about when the noise would stop, and management tried to placate with free drinks, trips into town etc etc.
Mold on walls, no hot water on second day, and had to ask multiple times and multiple front desk staff for attention/ cleaning etc. Beach is dirty with trash bags on beach.  Spoken to by General Manager who goes by Leon, and as he is friendly with our travel agent, offered free accommodation for when we return to Mirissa.

The rooms were so basic though it was large in size . There was a construction going on from early morning continuously  while the guests are residing which was soo disappointing and they stop whenever we complain only . We were upgraded to a different room and there was no water in the washroom plus the plunge pool area was very dirty . I think no one has gone to that area for a while as no one has cleaned the shower cubicle either . No standards in this hotel at all even the restaurant. Food was not good either , pancakes looked like hoppers and the plates and glasses were dirty .

Mr. Ashain and Mr. Padam Shri were always available to attend any such issues 24×7.

Man merkt, dass das Hotel eine gute Führung hat, da auch die oberen Manager den Gästen gegenüber hilfsbereit sind und ebenso ihre Mitarbeiter gut behandeln bzw. gut anleiten. Alle Angestellten geben sich sehr viel Mühe, sind freundlich und respektvoll. 

Im Front Office arbeitet Srimal als Manager, der sich sehr gut um die Gäste kümmert und sogar Fragen zu der besonderen Architektur des Hauses und der Zimmer beantworten kann. Der gesamte Hotelkomplex ist von einem Architekten entworfen, der viele gute Details mit eingebracht hat zB. die Indoor-Wasserflächen, die für ein gutes Raumklima im Rezeptions-Bereich sorgen. Die Zimmer sind geräumig, gut gestaltet und haben einen herrlichen Blick auf den Garten, die Palmen und das Meer.

Als Kundenbetreuerin (Guest Relation Manger) hatte ich Chalani, die immer sofort zur Stelle war, wenn einmal was nicht geklappt hat. Sie hat dafür sogar einmal Überstunden gemacht und ist dabei trotzdem fröhlich, freundlich und auf die Arbeit fokussiert geblieben. Bei Fragen, Problemen oder Störungen (selbst bei Kleinigkeiten) wurden sofort Menschen zur Behebung der Störung gesendet - und auch hier waren wieder alle Menschen sehr fleißig! 

Auch der Mann vom Zimmerservice (Zimmer 322) ist sehr freundlich - und baut manchmal süße Elefanten aus Handtüchern.

Und selbst die Hausmeister, die Parkplatzaufseher oder die Gärtner (die eigentlich weniger Kundenkontakt haben) sind den Gästen gegenüber freundlich zugewandt, sobald man eine Frage hat.

Last but not least: 
Das Essen ist super lecker - danke an alle Köche! 
Das Buffet bietet unterschiedliche Bereiche - Sri Lanka Küche, Indische Küche, Europäische Küche und internationale Küche sowie Grill Station, Suppen- , Salat-Buffet und Nachspeisen-Bereich. Alles absolut lecker und abwechslungsreich. 

Die Kellnerinnen und Kellner sind alle aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Leider kenne ich nicht alle mit Namen, aber Umayanga und Shehan sind darüber hinaus charmant, zuvorkommend, lernwillig und dabei trotzdem respektvoll distanziert.
Super Service! 

Und auch hier zeigt sich wieder die sehr gute Führung - N.S. Sanjeewa (Supervisor im Restaurant) behält alles gut im Blick, sorgt immer für einen reibungslosen Ablauf und auch er lächelt ganz wunderbar. Ihm zur Seite steht Tharaka (Hostess) die sich ebenso ganz wunderbar um die Tische sowie die Wünsche der Gäste kümmert.

Habt herzlichen Dank für den wunderschönen Urlaub, den ihr mir bereitet habt. 

Es ist einmalig schön hier!

Ich wünsche allen, dass sie ihre Ziele im Leben erreichen ... dabei aber zufrieden werden (und nicht krankhaft ehrgeizig und verbittert) und so locker und freundlich bleiben wie bisher.",Traumhaft schön und in Balance: strenge Architektur trifft auf freundliche Menschen,The Blue Water,0.9437337040455077,0.4085732826900327

AllisonB657,"We have recently had a return visit to this wonderful hotel to celebrate our 12th Wedding anniversary in the place we married in 2012.
All the wonderful staff went above and beyond to make our stay and in particular our anniversary a truly auspicious occasion.
Duminda , kushani, Ravin, Dinnesh and all the lovely staff in the restaurant and behind the scenes were faultless .
We were given the same great room we had stayed in 12 years ago , our anniversary meal was exceptional and our overall stay most comfortable and enjoyable.
The buffet is lovely in the evenings and breakfasts excellent.
The gardens are immaculate and the beach clean and enjoyable to stroll along. The sea tends to be quite rough so not good for swimming or snorkeling at this time of year.
We will certainly be returning and hopefully sooner .
A big thank you to all.  Our only suggestion going forwards is perhaps some new poolside parasols and tables needed .","A fabulous stay , again !",The Blue Water,0.9437337040455077,0.4085732826900327
dhanushkadihan,"We stayed 23-24 September on our brief return from UK to SL. It is our second time in Blue Waters after our honeymoon stay in 2022. The hotel has the same relaxing atmosphere. The best thing is they treat with same respect/courtesy/and hospitability for the Sri Lankans which is the best thing about Blue Waters.

The front line office manager gave us the Bawa tour which was really nice, and all the meticulous details about its architectural grandeur. With regard to dinning, I wished if there could be more varieties of rice and other dishes for dinner and breakfast taking into account the Sri Lankan guests. I am saying this in comparison our dinning experiences in the year 2022 (May)

I must especially mention about G.S Sanjeewa the supervisor of the restaurant. He was such a nice company. His small talks with great courtesy and full of friendliness,  made our dinning experience richer and fuller. Such a lovely hospitable, welcoming gestures from staff like Sanjeewa, make us to feel come again, which we will definitely do next year.",Great Hotel and Lovely Staff,The Blue Water,0.9437337040455077,-0.7649882739728273

All staff members in all departments were simply amazing and offered an outstanding and perfect customer service. They went above and beyond to create a memorable stay.
We tried all the F&B outlets of the property. A la carte in the S Kitchen was super delicious, the buffet at S-Kitchen was good and the variety and quality of food top. They cater a huge variety of food for all tastes.
Breakfast buffet was huge and a feast.
The fresh food and fish at Olive restaurant were top notch, the pool bar great and the cocktails delicious.

The pool area is absolutely massive and one of the biggest we have seen. Plenty of loungers and parasols. The lush green garden with palm trees next to the pool is super well maintained and has a beach volleyball court.
The hotel offers direct access to the beach. You could swim but currents are too strong. This is the case on many beaches in Sri Lanka and you have to look for a designated swimming beach.
Sunsets at Kosgoda Beach are from another world. We enjoyed it at the beach itself with a sundowner or from the Rooftop bar. 
The Spa is heaven and prices are reasonable.

Упал навзничь, через несколько секунд на него упали осколки этой двери. После этого мы попали просто в заложники. Помощь ребёнку не оказали, с нас потребовали 800 долларов за дверь. Доводы, что на двери должна быть защитная пленка, предупреждающие наклейки  не действовали. Это был последний день перед вылетом домой. Денег таких у нас с собой не было. Попросили сделать скидку, но персонал ответил, что это наши проблемы. Через гида мы обменяли рубли на доллары. Но оказалось, что на 200 долларах были пометки и на РЕСЕПШЕН ИХ НЕ ПРИНЯЛИ. Время уже 11 вечера. Нам ничем не помогают. Просили показать камеры, тк ребёнок сказал, что стекло разбилось от падения вазы, не показали.

247kellil,"The best things about this hotel are the staff and the location.

Gorgeous views looking across Lake Tissa, watching the sunset was magical. The pool was a comfortable temperature and it was exciting to see a large monitor wandering across the grass.

The staff were very friendly and accomodating, helping carry bags up the stairs and looking after us very well in the restaurant.

What lets this hotel down is maintenance. It appears that some upkeep is currently being done, but it is quite shabby. Once you walk away from the lovely reception area you can see how tired the hotel is - peeling paint, cracked tiles, stained sunlounge cushions. Random storage areas were visible and also looked worn. 

The main part of the room was fine, though there are no PowerPoints beside the bed. The bathroom needs some work - shower head was calcified and needs with a good clean or replacement. There was damage to walls where things possibly had been removed. The cupboard just looks old.

There were flys in the buffet food area, and sometimes in the food. One of the air con units in the restaurant was dripping water onto the floor. But the staff in the restaurant were wonderful - explaining dishes and making sure we had enough.

I can see this once would have been a beautiful well maintained 4 star resort but it felt more like a 3 star. Hopefully with continued renovation it can return to what it once was.","Great staff, great location, hotel a little tired.",EKHO Safari Tissa,-0.11038218401622989,-1.9385498306356874

han1816,"We stayed at this hotel on Tuesday, October 8, 2024, planning to check out on the 10th but left after one night due to severe issues with the room and facilities.

While the reception area appears well-maintained, it conceals the hotel's overall neglect. We were given a lower-ground room with a lake view, but it had a strong musty smell, damp air, and visible mould on a lampshade. During a rainstorm, water seeped through the doors leading to the lake, and we had to mop up to prevent flooding.

After a tiring day of travel, we decided to report these issues the next morning. A brief walk around the hotel revealed further signs of neglect: missing tiles and loose light fixtures around the pool, broken sunbeds, and general uncleanliness in common areas.

We’d booked a 5 am safari with the hotel, so we retired early. However, at 4:30 am, we awoke to find blood stains on the sheets from bedbug bites, with bugs still crawling on the bed (photos attached). We immediately went to the front desk, but the safari driver hurriedly took us to the tour without addressing our concerns. Shaken by the experience we decided we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the safari and so returned to the hotel and chose to check out early.

Upon our return, I spoke with Angela, the hotel manager, who agreed to refund both nights through Priceline, the booking service we used. She explained that Priceline would need to contact the hotel directly to process the refund. However, nearly a month later, I’ve received confirmation that EKHO has been ignoring Priceline’s requests, refusing to approve the refund.

This experience reflects a lack of cleanliness, safety, and integrity at this hotel. I would caution others to consider these issues before booking.",DO NOT STAY HERE - BED BUGS AND UNCLEAN!!,EKHO Safari Tissa,-0.11038218401622989,-4.285672943961408

25cool,"We had a three night stay at Mandara Hotel, Mirissa. Our expectations were high after going through social media and seeing the photos. On arrival, no one welcomed us. Our driver had to carry our luggage to the lobby area. Got a free room with sea view. #97  just above the gym. The room was specious but had broken luggage rack and issues with water pressure. We didn't mind it. After using the gym,  tried to take a shower but no hot water. informed the front office and the young gentleman told he will inform the maintenance. Half an hour later, since nothing happened went to reception to check. The same gentleman told they can't do anything. So I requested a room change. The receptionist told they are full and don't have any rooms available for a room change. Since we booked the room via Agoda, checked the Agoda website and to my surprise there were enough rooms to book. So I booked a room for euro 88 for one night and showed the receptionist  to give a room since I have made an extra booking. Then, a few of the management staff got involved and offered a room change. Saying they are not full and have enough rooms to move. The next day, the general manager requested us to come to his office to talk about the situation. Wonder why he didn't come to us instead.  Felt like going to the principals office all over again. After talking to GM, Mr. Liyanage  assured that a refund would be authorised to Agoda. As promised he authorised a refund for one night but the authorization was not for the euro 88 booking which I did for the night but the first night out of the tree nights block booking which was euro 65.
We feel like we were ripped off  for a hotel, which is not up to standards. Bed sheets were patched, bathroom fittings were loose, and television fittings were hanging. Staff not trained or not interested but i must say, except few hard working staff members. Kishan from the restaurant who is a hardworking person and Anupama the executive house keeper. Who had just started but tried to do everything to make our stay a good one. According to GM one of our booking came to another ota, so they couldn't refund the room night, which was booked for euro 88 but the cheaper night.

Service was excellent. From the point I called Mr Liyanage for the booking till I checked out, each and every person went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. The gentleman at the restaurant named Arthur ( I think thats his name) always had our favorite spot reserved and prepared for us without us even requesting for it. The pool attendant also was exceptionally helpful.
Location is really nice with the ocean in the front and the Polwatta river on the side. Also during our stay we managed to visit Mathara fort, Secret Beach, Coconut Tree Hill & Hakgedi Ella waterfall all within half an hours drive from the hotel.

Positive experiences 
Staff really helpful, attentive and service minded.
Two good pools, one with chloride water and one salt water pool. Really nice and clean, our children really enjoyed them.
Restaurant has a good mix of food in good quality, easy to find something to eat for both children and adults.

Less positive experiences
Room and pool area seems worn and could use some renovation to allow for the four stars rating. We had a two floor room, the wooden floor on the top floor, there the lacquer was loose, resulting in that these remains were everywhere.
One morning we woke up because they decided to work on the roof in our room from 8:00 in the morning, not impressive, but to their defense they did stop this after we complained at the reception. At that point we were already awake.

To sum up then the hotel could for sure benefit from a renovation of the rooms and the exterior areas. It is located in proximity to the sea, but no beach and the water is too extreme to allow for swimming in the sea, at least the days we were there.the beach have rocks, no sand.

Но лично для меня не  составило проблему , таак как в отеле имеется гольфкар, управляемый дружелюбным водителем Джента, который совершенно бесплатно отвезет вас на пляж отеля Thaproban beach, где вам будут предоставлены бесплатные лежаки. Сам отель предустал и нуждается в мелком ремонте. Нам достался большой номер с видом на бассейн и океан. Кровать большая матрас хороший. Холодильник стандартный для отеля напитки охлаждал хорошо. ТВ не смотрели, не было нужды. Санузел большой, имеется душевая кабина, полотенца менялись регулярно. В проживание был включен завтрак. Завтраки обилием не отличались, но были довольно сносные, голодными не уходили. На завтрак были и национальная кухня и выпечка, услужливые официанты предлагали яичницу. Вообще хочется отметить персонал отеля, ребята молодцы работают на 5+. Это касается персонала и рецепции и ресторана и уборщиков. Такого отношения, дружелюбия я не встречал в отелях. Минусом отеля является как я уже писал отсутствие пляжа, а так же удаленность от активностей «туристической» улицы.

amyrB8962VJ,"This was a truly lovely place to stay, the staff were lovely, the room was lovely - we loved it! We stayed in a family room which meant the children were upstairs where there was a large double bed and a cot was provided too which was perfectly big enough for our nearly-two year old. We were thankful for that as we didn't want him having access to the stairs. The room was really big, there aren't any windows downstairs really but it was so hot outside we were quite grateful for that. I read some reviews on here about the breakfast buffet being a bit disappointing and I can't say I stay in a lot of fancy hotels but I thought it was absolutely fine. It wasn't the fanciest buffet I've ever seen but there is so much choice: an egg station, a hopper station, pancakes, rotis, sri lankan specialities, pastries, cereals, fresh fruit and more that I can't see how everyone wouldn't be able to find something delightful to try every day. The coffee however, is poor - we brought our own cafetiere and ground coffee on the trip as we found this with most of the places we stayed. We didn't try the paid-for fancy coffees on offer so can't comment on those but I do think that it would be nice for at least one of those to be included in the bed and breakfast price for adults.
The pools were great for kids, we loved both of them. Particularly having an evening swim in the saltwater one which was right by our room, so warm and lovely to cool off with a baby section and a deeper section - our children loved it. The playroom was a big hit with our children too, the air con wasn't working initially but the staff fixed that immediately which was appreciated. It does smell pretty funky in that room though which isn't unusual for a children's play area but it's a little off-putting (for adults, my kids could not have cared less, they loved it.)
The staff are really friendly and helpful - one of the team noticed that we needed extra napkins at breakfast on our first morning and every day after that we had them immediately and they even offered us a fabric napkin each day to help our nearly-two year old not make so much of a mess. It's the little touches like this as well as everyone being so kind and friendly to us and our children that made our stay very special.
The only downside was the Pina Colada we had there which was very bad. The chap making it made quite a show of opening a large bag of powdered coconut milk in front of me which is a real shame when you're in a country with fresh coconut everywhere! I didn't see the rest of the ingredients but can't imagine fresh juice was used either, it was nearly undrinkable (in fact my wife didn't drink hers) but the G&Ts we chose on later evenings were lovely.
The location is a little out of the way right at the end of a long windy street with lots of shops and restaurants on it but it was fun zooming up and down on tuk tuks when we were too tired or hot to walk and we also used the buggy service to get back from one of their other sites at the beach one day too.

Staff are professional yet friendly. They attend to our  needs promptly with a smile. The hotel is situated on a slight hill and is quite central to the town. (Seven minutes walk.)

We had the pleasure of dining in the casual restaurant here. Food was tasty ,Ramesh  and  his team were very attentive and professional.                   I also had the opportunity to try  Sri Lankan breakfast which was delicious, string hoppers and the curries were yummy .

alanar533,"The service was pretty average as you’d have to order an hour before you actually receive your food and/or beverage. I wouldn’t recommend the coffee or any hot bevy to do with milk as the milk tasted bland and the black coffee was super watery. The food was quite average as well, could’ve had runnier poached eggs. 
The best bit in terms of drinks were the cocktails, very well done and delicious.
The sights were quite breathtaking to see so many flowers and green grass, strange to see it in Sri Lanka but no complaints on that part. 
The beds were quite comfortable and very clean. There only thing about the bed was that with every movement I made, a loud creak noise occurred. The staff do place a hot water bottle underneath the sheets for the night which is very much needed.

We stayed in a spacious sea view cabana that was perfectly equipped for all weather conditions, whether rain (umbrellas) or shine (bug spray). The cabana offered a great balance of luxury and comfort, with more than enough space to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings.

The service was impeccable throughout our stay. Special mention to Dinesh, who went above and beyond to organize a beautiful birthday meal right on the beach—an experience we’ll never forget. Our butler, Dulanjana, was outstanding. He was professional, attentive, and made sure we had no worries during our stay. His care and attention to detail truly enhanced our experience.

The food at Jetwing Surf was incredible. Every meal was a visual and culinary delight, thanks to the talented chef. The quality and presentation were always of the highest standard. Even during our early morning safari, the hotel ensured that we had a packed breakfast and drinks ready for our 5 AM departure, which was a thoughtful touch.

Our safari at Kumana National Park was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of our trip. This was all recommended and arranged by the resort.  We were lucky enough to see leopards, elephants, deer, and so many other animals up close in their natural habitat. The wildlife was abundant, and the best part was how peaceful it felt—at times, it seemed like we had the entire park to ourselves!

The experience was well-organized and truly immersive. The beauty of Kumana lies not just in the animals but also in the quiet, untouched wilderness. It’s a must-do for anyone visiting the area, and we highly recommend it!

We also indulged in in-room massages, which were fantastic—perfect for unwinding. The pool was clean and a great spot to relax during the day.

This resort truly goes above and beyond, treating guests like royalty. We are already recommending it to our friends and family and cannot wait to return ourselves. A huge thank you to the team for making our stay so memorable!",Amazing experience!,Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,0.4085732826900327

RuthyGlasgow,"Gave a review of Very Good but that was because of the location. At check in our guide spoke to the receptionist as I had asked if our room was a sea view, and told only partial. So asked if we could upgrade but that was a no, and felt that the young lady was a bit unfriendly. Our guide spoke for us and we were offered another room and I could go see both and choose, which I thought was kind but I am sure it was our guide whom the receptionist was trying to please? We chose the second room S04 which had a better sea view than S09? Room was clean enough. The dining room is down at the beach and just loved having breakfast there albeit there was not a lot of choice but they did make my husband porridge oats every morning which he loved. We chose this hotel rather than the Marriot next door as wanted more of a Sri Lankan experience rather than be in a modern sky scraper building. Dining staff very friendly, more friendly than Miss Snotty at reception! I loved the beach area which was very clean and tidy, though walking along the beach to the right and left you found that the beach there was not clean and filled with rubbish, really shocking, and so glad that we were at the most cleanest part of this beautiful surfers paradise. We just loved sitting on the chairs on the raised stoned area looking out to the sea and watching all the new surfers being trained. Our Half Board menu was ok and enjoyed what we had chosen but the coconut ice cream is to die for, absolutely amazing! Our flights back were late at night and asked Miss Snotty if we could have a late check out, but it would  cost us $117 for 5 hours, I asked if they could do better and since we were half board would they give us some kind of meal or snack before leaving. A definite no but brought the price down to $100. So we agreed on the price but asked if fresh towels and bottles of water could be provided and yes to towels but no to water?  I said to them that we felt that was very mean not to give us the water and they relented. We felt that the receptionist was unhelpful (only doing the minimum)  and bit unfriendly when we were asking on tuc tucs to Mirissa and also a driver to take us to Galle. The hotel driver was so very friendly on our trip to Galle which we thoroughly enjoyed as was the tuc tuc driver to Mirissa. Lovely lovely people. The location of the hotel, The clean beach and pool area and attendants,  the friendliness from the dining staff and where the dining room was were for us the best parts of our stay there.

Когда попросил добавить уборщиков тюбики с шампунем и гелем для душа, они при мне взяли пустые тюбики и начали их наполнять из пластиковых бутылок из под воды, то есть непонятно что у них там разведено. Меню на завтра очень скудное. На ужине официанты по 10 раз переспрашивает что ты заказывал. Долго готовят. Год назад ездили в отель eden но в берувеле, так вот там намного лучше сервис, номерной фонд и территория.

Mouthwatering food.  beach is very clean and all stakeholders including all other hotels and surf schools  are taking care of it.  One can surf  either side of the hotel beaches. Very safe and well maintained swimming pool add more glamor. Anyhow prices are very unreasonable. A water bottle cost me Rs 650 and the same brand of it , within 100 meters from hotel was only Rs 120.  For our first lunch cost us Rs 33,000+ as they refused to add that to FB saying it starts from Dinner!! but since we had one dinner out side and skipped the lunch the day we departed, altered bill from full board to HF , reduction  was only 4000+/day.  This is absurd and we have never experience such in any other place. Such pricing may get them quick returns but ruined their reputation much quicker.

The bungalows were connected to each other which was great as a family and the space was very roomy. The villa was also perfect for two people. The resort itself was very beautiful with long palm trees that makes you feel like you are in paradise, a swimming pool with Jacuzzi, spa, and restaurant. 

The resort is also connected to Welligama beach which is ideal if you want to have some drinks with some breeze looking at surfers or book some surfing lessons (well worth it!). There are also a number of food courts nearby if you want to try local cuisine. It is also nice to go for a walk and talk with some locals.

Most importantly, the entire staff make you feel very welcome. Not only do they provide good service (what you expect from a resort), but they are also observant and friendly. For example, I was interested in discovering some Sri Lankan music and they played a diverse list of songs.

The rooms were very spacious, had bathrobes, iron with board, tea station, fresh filtered water everyday, smart tv and comfortable beds. The only con is the window connecting from the room into the bathroom. The breakfast and dinner buffet never disappointed. Staff provide filtered water at the restaurants. All the staff were very friendly and always willing to help. The pool is very clean and showers available to rinse off afterwards. The beach was very beautiful and 3 minute walk away from our room. Unfortunately, it was off season so the ocean was not safe to swim in. Still beautiful to watch though. Saw a herd of cows running along the beach which was an absolute delight to watch. You see over 100 green parrots arriving in the evening and sitting in the palm trees near the beach. I also recommend the hotel spa. I had lots of aches and pains from the trip and long flights.

maddys444,"We, a group of four girls, ended our Sri Lankan tour with an idyllic stay for 4 nights at The Blue Water Hotel and Spa. This hotel was just what we needed after a long trip around Sri Lanka. Absolutely everything was first class - from the managers, the customer service at reception, the porters, to the catering and housekeeping staff, everyone went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. No job was too big for anyone. The warm bright smiles and attentive nature of all staff made us feel at home. In particular, the managers, Dumindu and Kushani were exceptional in their leadership. The  reception staff, Shakila, Chamika, and Dilshan were always on hand for anything we needed. 

The spacious rooms, with a private garden leading to the swimming pool was a dream. Clean rooms, lovely bathroom amenities, smart TV all added to the experience. The beds were so comfortable, that we slept in most mornings! Yet the staff at breakfast still accommodated past the breakfast time. The garden/pool views from the room were so relaxing, I felt like I was in tropic heaven! 

The food was mouth watering and delicious. Something I looked forward to every morning and evening. The variety of choice with the fruits and salads, the mains and desserts, everything was cooked to perfection. I have a dairy allergy, so the staff would let me know what dessert options were suitable for me.

pavitrar2024,"This was our maiden visit from India  to Sri Lanka and also to Jetwing Surf  and Kottukal Beach House at Pottuvil , in connection with solemnising marriage ceremony of our elder son  with a British bride. The journey through and stay in SL were superb , and the Jetwing Surf and Kottukal Beach house ,Pottuvil, were special. This marriage celebration hoisting was also, it seems, was maiden for the Jetwing Pottuvil. The rooms, Breakfast-Lunch-Dinner services, Venue preparation, Haldi ceremoney, Sangeet ceremony, Marriage ceremony, Dance and cultural  functions , marriage dinners on sea beach,  arranging Marriage Registration at the venue etc were all meticulously planned and executed to perfection.
Our hearts were filled with with joy and happiness by seeing all the arrangement at the venue, the sea beach, the scenic beauty of the resort and the spacious rooms  and the decorated swimming pool sites to suit the occasions.
The food services served at the occasions were very good.
The sea beaches, lawns, swimming pools etc, especially at Kottukal Beach House, were so beautiful that one has to get lost into one's romantic days. 
Above all , the Management and staff of the both the resorts deserve all praise for their services, behaviour, courtesy and ever willingness on their parts to be of any kind of help at any time were praiseworthy. 
We wish  to return to this venue again on any other occasion  with friends and family. 
Certian suggestions : 
1. The road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach house , about 100 mtrs stretch length, is not metalled - it is broken . Walking is difficult on the road. Better it is repaired and maintained by both the resorts.
2. There is paucity of light on the road from Jetwing Surf to Kottukal Beach House.  Both the resorts can look into this aspect and arrange proper lights.
3. Jetwing surf can maintain a e-rickshaw ( tuktuk) service within their resort and also between the two resorts so that commuting between the two places is not troblesome. 
Save and above , our overall experince in Jetwing and SL were tremendous and memorable.","Destination marriage at Jetwing Surf , Sri Lanka",Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,0.4085732826900327

Review of Jetwing Surf
Reviewed 13 Nov 2022

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * *

I would like to start by referring to my earlier review posted to Trip Advisor dated 13th November 2022 re the visit to Jetwing Surf, Pottuvil Point, Sri Lanka.

This second visit was on Sunday 4th February 2024 when eleven of us booked into 6 Cabanas in great trepidation as the others had at the last minute read my 13th November 2022 review.  Some of the servers recognized us & assured us that we will be happy this time & we were.

All Cabanas had glass panels placed right up to the architecturally beautiful Conic Rooves, blocking out any insects & creepy crawlies which made our previous stay miserable.   They only had fans inside the Cabanas then.  Now they have installed air conditioners too.  

It would have cost them quite a bit.  However, I hope guests will read this review of mine & visit the place hopefully not just for a day or two.  Why not make it a beautiful vacation during the season and I assure you, no one will regret it.

The No. 12 Cabana my husband & I occupied had an extremely comfortable King-size bed with pillows so perfect, only the alarm would wake us from sleep.  All other amenities from a mini bar, coffee/tea service to hair dryer, little toiletries, bathrobes, beach slippers, umbrellas etc. etc. were there for our use.  The shower toilet area is unique with a style of its own.

Though there is no Television set in the Resort, we had free Wi-Fi service.

There was a hiccup in our No.12 Cabana which was not the case with the ones occupied by our friends.  The Toilet had a suction issue which the management tried hard to correct not quite successfully & in fact, offered a change of Cabana too which we did not take up.  

The service all round was excellent.  Led by Pavan (butler/server/other roles), the staff worked at tandem & the Chef de cuisine made sure we had the desired à la carte meals presented in decorative style.  On this occasion, all meals were flavoursome & the quantity just right.   Way to go Chef Gemunu Chameera & Team!

The Swimming pool & the surrounding area in the resort is beautiful.  Once more, I hope the management will make the (romantic) lighting on the ground better as we had to use our cellphone lights to walk the area leading to the dining hall. 

Our trip this time was not during the season.  One should go to the East Coast during the dry season which is from May to September when the beaches are pristine, the sea of Sri Lanka is calmer & water sports are possible.

As a final note, my husband & I were absolutely thrilled with the Management as they had in a matter of 15 months, attended to my & maybe other guests’ previous comments about shortfalls.   

Kudos & blessings to the Jetwing Surf Resident Manager Mr. Azeem Hafi, & his dedicated, pleasant Team.

D3586UWsteveb,Beautiful and relaxing hotel situated next to the beach. Relatively small with about 20 or so cabanas / huts but each is very generously sized and can easily accommodate 4 people. Staff were great and very attentive with our own ‘personal butler’. As the hotel is relatively small the menu is a la carte with a western and Srilankan option. East part of Sri Lanka is still  underdeveloped compared to the south west with smaller surfer hotels along the coast. Have to be willing to be more adventurous if you want to go out of the hotel. As it is a surfer destination and the season starts in March / April a lot of the nearby smaller hotels were closed as was the local surf school.,Beautiful stay in Arugam Bay,Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,0.4085732826900327

2. When the water started to run, it started overflowing out of the shower due to a block in the drainage system. We requested someone from maintenance visit and check it out. And they promptly did. But the block in the shower could not be fixed. We requested another room, which was given, and we had to re-pack and move. What bothered me most was not having to move, but the room which we were in was promptly cleaned and given to another new guest. (Who probably had to put up with a clogged drainage system)

3. Then it was the food. Terrible to say the least. Let me explain. The hotel offered a half board deal. Breakfast ordered was western. There was hardly any meat included. No bacon, sausages nothing that’s included in a usual western breakfast. Add insult to injury, the baked beans were substituted by chick peas in ketchup (tasted like it). When we inquired about the meat, the hotel said bacon was not offered, given the neighborhood was predominately Islamic, and to respect the community. We accepted that and then inquired as to why the hotel did not include other meats? There was no acceptable answer, but said a hotel made chicken patti is included. We tried the chicken patties and it was terrible.

This to me was a real rip off. Similar experience at dinner as well. By the third night we decided not to have dinner at the hotel. We drove to Arugambay and had some decent food.

4. The point is that the owners and the management appears to be charging relatively high rates and really cutting down on the quality of the food to max out on profits. ( nothing against making profits, but charging high for a sub standard product is not acceptable)

5. Few other things to note about Jetwing surf are:
        i. Not the ideal location for sea bathing or other ocean related activity 
        ii. Really cheaply constricted  hotel being presented as an great experience
       iii. Location not as great as Arugambay ( better food, accommodation and other activity like surfing in Arugambay)
       iv. Watch out for centipedes in your room and on your bed before jumping in to bed. ( had a close call)

The only positives about this hotel was: the staff was excellent and Wi-Fi was good.

Will not visit again.

I guess you get the point.",Poor experience. Rip off. Will not visit ever again.,Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,-3.1121113872985475

Companion47145277271,Jetwing Surf is a fantastic spot for a getaway. We went there during the rainy season .  When it rains the horizon simply vanishes. Yet there was enough sun shine during the day for a stroll along the spectacular Arugambay beach. The property is located close to the beach and the view from each window is breathtaking.  Staff was very courteous and professional specially the restaurant staff the manager in particular and the steward (Mr.Lakshan)  who was assigned to assist us during our stay. The food was very delicious and served a la carte but had a few set menus for each day with a good choice of local and western  preparations. The rooms  (cabanas) are fully air conditioned and  have thatched roofs .  The shower area in the washroom had an issue with the water outlet.  Water was stagnant and draining out very slowly. But nothing to complain. All in all it was a pleasant and memorable experience.  You must visit this secluded part of the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka at least once in a life time.

Stay594854,"We recently spent 10 days at The Blue Water, Wadduwa, in August 2024, and overall, we had an absolutely delightful experience. While we wouldn't classify this as a 5-star hotel by international standards, we were very satisfied with our stay.

The hotel boasts stunning architecture, featuring large open spaces that beautifully blend the indoors with the outdoors. Although the hotel shows signs of age and could benefit from some modernization, the overall ambiance and setting were incredible.

Dining:
The hotel offers both à la carte and buffet dining options. The buffet consistently featured a mix of ""Western"" cuisine, Indian dishes, and local Sri Lankan specialties. The variety and quality of the food were excellent, with flavors that truly delighted our taste buds. The selection of beverages was also more than satisfactory.

Service:
The hotel staff were consistently friendly, smiling, and helpful throughout our stay.

Facilities:
The outdoor areas, including the beach, were clean and well-maintained. The pool was large and kept in excellent condition. There were always enough sunbeds available, and the attentive staff were quick to prepare them for us as soon as we approached.

A special thank you goes to Aruna and his team at the Pool Bar. His warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay—Aruna, a big thank you!

A Few Tips for Improvement:

- The hotel would benefit from a planned and gradual modernization process.
- The preparation time for meals and drinks in the à la carte restaurant was relatively long, even though the hotel was not busy during our stay (off-season). It might be worth considering better kitchen management. However, the wait was ultimately worth it as the food was delicious.",Wonderful Stay with a Few Areas for Improvement,The Blue Water,0.9437337040455077,0.4085732826900327

Despite the departure of its original members and having opened its door to welcome Sri Lankan members into the Club in 1967, the Club continues to operate as a members-only institution. To sustain its legacy and standards, the Club has also opened its doors to Temporary members (Tourists). The traditions of The Hill Club reflect its rich history and cultural significance. For dinner, gentlemen are required to wear a jacket and tie, maintaining an air of sophistication, while ladies are encouraged to dress stylishly.

Меню разнообразное, персонал отлично говорит на английском. Гид Николос тусуется у пляжа, может на тук-туке свозить вас на экскурсию в Негомбо - показать пляжи, рынки, магазинчики, свозить в банк, предложить экскурсии и т.д.

Из нюансов, котореы хотелось бы знать заранее - рядом с отелем тут нет вообще ничего, выходишь и попадаешь в частный сектор)) частные домики, некоторые красивые, некоторые нет. До ближайшего магазина нормального топать минут 20 в одну сторону
короче этот отель идеален больше для такого отдыха типо полежать у басика, позагорать. Гулять тут особо негде
пляж у отеля чистый, но стоит отойти буквально пару метров в сторону и там кучи мусора, я так думаю его океан приносит во время штормов
нам и не особо надо было, мы отлично у басика лежали, просто если будешь еще кому советовать предупреди на всякий)

Думаю что с детьми тут тоже будет нормально потому что у бассейна несколько зон - поглубже и помельче. Бассейн достаточно большой, чистый, красивый, с видом на океан, вообще класс.
Коктейли в баре не очень, на количестве алкоголя экономят конечно, но в целом вкусно) 

и еще, как оказалось, вот с 10 сентября тут начинается сезон дождей на 2-3 месяца. Так что нам чисто повезло что большая часть отпуска была до него. Мы обсуждали и я думала что сезон дождей закончится в сентябре, а оказывается он вот только начнется, но это чисто мой просчет, просто будьте в курсе)",Отель для спокойного отдыха и полного релакса),Suriya Resort,-0.25249262225862706,0.4085732826900327

paulhZ6050FI,"Just spent 4 nights at this hotel.
Positives absolutely kind friendly staff the grounds are beautifully maintained and it’s right on the beach.
We paid for a premium room which was a front villa with amazing views.  
The room staff did an amazing job with towel art and kept the room spotless.  
The restaurant table service was excellent with lovely tables and comfortable chairs.
We ate out most nights for a variety.  The chef was kind enough to cook some SriLankan food as an alternative to set breakfast.  He was really accommodating and friendly.

The room wasn’t ready upon arrival as the air conditioning wasn’t working.  They had about 4 maintenance crew having a look at it.   Eventually they got it going.  It’s an old rusted out Toshiba Air con but certainly cooled the room very quick.   The room was lovely and well fitted out.  The bath room is dated but certainly did the job.

Sadly Air Conditioner broke down again which couldn’t be fixed.  The only ignoring part is they knew it was broken before we arrived as a part had burnt out causing it to trip power on the compressor.

We were moved to a different room which was slightly smaller and had a cheap Chinese air conditioner which was undersized for the room. It didn’t really chill the room much.  This villa type on Agoda was about $30 cheaper a night.  The bath room on this villa had a rotted out shower frame with various mould types from black, pink and a kind of brown colour.  Green moss was also growing on frame.  It was so rotted that caused the bathroom to flood when you had a shower.   It is a slip hazard we just used towels where the holes were.
I figured if you didn’t touch the mould you would be ok.   Not sure how children would go but they did have an option of a bath.

Only  5 rooms were booked in the whole place as it was there off season.  Hopefully repairs will occur.  The Marriott is next door for the same price if you like high rise accomodation or W15 which is also a couple of doors down and much newer.

I really loved the location of the hotel.  The surf instructor was fantastic.  
In fact all the staff are a credit to this hotel.  They just need to spend some money on maintenance.  Our shower hose was split which I didn’t really care about but certainly other guests would this is a very easy fix.",Beautiful location friendly staff.

Meget flott hotell;men  vi ble ikke enige om prisen med Marriott og gikk til slutt bare 50 meter ved siden av til naboen! Et koselig hotell i kun 3 etasjer og 8 nydelige flotte hytter i hagen ned mot sjøen. Vi fikk tilbud på hytte nr 1, med terrasse og nærmest stranden. Da var det gjort for oss.:)
Hele bukta, kilometervis med flott sandstrand i begge retninger.Her skulle det gåes på tur, trimmes hver dag! Flott stort svømmebasseng nesten ved stranden fantes det også,  + en koselig strandrestaurant bygning for alle måltider.
Ellers så må det nevnes at rett utenfor hyttedøra så var det daglig store ansamlinger med surfere på brett ute i bukta. De fleste var nok nybegynnere, og bølgene var ikke farlige heller! Dertil la vi merke til at de fleste likte å ligge/sitte på surfebrettene sine, samlet i klynger for å skravle/sosialisere; herlig å se på :)

I can only say we were blown away by the level of service from the lovely staff. 

The chef and restaurant manager were exceptional and so lovely. They greeted us every day and made us off menu food as well. Every meal we had was delicious and pretty reasonably priced for the area. 

One day we mentioned we were going whale watching the next morning and the chef went out of his way to make us a packed breakfast to our liking and left with security for us to take with us at 5am. 

One day when I fancied a Sri Lankan breakfast they made me my own beautiful meal with so much food. I can’t stress how much they made our stay amazing.

The Good
The arrival was smooth and easy - we had a great first impression of the resort and room. The staff were very welcoming and had setup the villa nicely - also with a crib for our daughter. We also had a few bookings in the spa - highly recommend the masseuse and his treatments.

The Bad & Ugly
Unfortunately one can only book a room with breakfast. Furthermore, the Christmas and New Years Eve dinners were mandatory - the prices charged were excessive for the service and food quality offered. There was an issue every time for opening hours (they were never ready for breakfast!), communicating the buffet time for Christmas eve - we entirely missed out on the BBQ as they said that the BBQ and buffet would close at 11pm - yet it closed at 10pm! As soon as the restaurant was at half capacity, the service and food delivery would slow down significantly - we would end up wasting a lot of time waiting to order and then waiting for the food to arrive. Even for simple orders such as a tea - delivery time would be in excess of 30 minutes! The BBQ was overrated - the food was pre-cooked and then they just threw it onto the grill to re-heat it (with the exception of the lobster) - the calamary was as chewy as a shoe-sole / simply not eatable - when I mentioned it to the executive chef (who was busy with everything but overseeing the kitchen and grill operation), he gave an impolite 'this is Sri Lankan calamary' - this response and lack of care makes absolutely no sense! Furthermore, the gala dinner buffet was served in the hot restaurant space (AC clearly did not work), which makes it unsanitary for any raw food items and allow for bacteria to develop - especially on the raw fish items. Even the staff were sweating and struggling in the hot and humid restaurant space - luckily all the seating was outside.
By the end of our trip, we frequently ended up going next door to the Marriott for breakfast, lunch and dinner - the prices were similar, the service was way better and we even got breakfast and a few other meals comped.

Conclusion
You can stay here and have a good time, as long as you pay for room only and do not go to the restaurant - unless you want to waste time, money and eat shoe-soles.","We had an amazing stay; however, avoid the restaurant!",Weligama Bay Resort,-0.6585224458083334,-1.9385498306356874

While other guest who arrived later than us got their meal pretty early. In the morning breakfast they didn’t have any Vegetarian dish to be served.

Cheebs,"This hotel trades off the views which are undoubtedly quite lovely. My room was clean, and bed very comfortable. Overall, this is all very acceptable and the staff are excessively helpful and attentive which can't be faulted.

The location is very good albeit up a steep hill from the main street thronging with restaurants.

There are some challenges that would, otherwise, make this a luxury experience... selecting TV channels on the two remotes is clunky; there is no chair in the room other than a beanbag, so lounging on the bed is the only option; there's no luggage stand, so leaving open luggage on the floor is not ideal with occasional creepy crawlies around; the light switch is not within reach of the bed; the hot water for the shower never gets beyond tepid which is ok given the hot weather; shower gel and soap is limited to one small plastic bottle and a tiny hand soap which doesn't compare to modern luxury hotels offering refillable shower and hand gel; drinking water is limited to two small bottles during your stay unless you ask for more (they are very accommodating).

So, while this independent hotel is lovely and welcoming, and a cut above most local options in Ella, it's not quite a polished luxury experience if that's what you're expecting. Overall I'd recommend Hotel Onrock as a great Ella option though.","Yes, the view is great!",Hotel Onrock,-0.8115644562232227,0.4085732826900327

Room was clean with a light airy feel and did not contain heavy furnishings. Bed was definitely comfortable and if anything else was needed they would have provided it when asked. You could easily stay in this room for a few nights and not be cramped.
Breakfast was simple but had variety. Eggs cooked to order which was nice.

Carlo59,"Abbiamo trascorso 6 giorni e 5 notti, abbiamo dormito 1 notte negli Chalets, 4 notti in una cabana. Si tratta di due resort distinti, a poca distanza, ma diversi, con due distinti ristoranti e gestori diversi, con unica proprietà. Li abbiamo provati entrambi ed entrambi sono risultati eccellenti, personalmente, sia per qualità del resort che del servizio, ritengo che le ""beach cabanas"" siano migliori. Abbiamo soggiornato, fatto colazione, cenato e fatto varie merende per 6 giorni, eravamo in tre ed abbiamo saggiato a fondo le strutture: sono eccellenti e molto consigliabili.
Localizzazione: Eccellente, in un tratto di mare deserto, affollato solo dalle Green Turtles che venivano la sera a deporre le uova. Mare splendido, da notare che occorre essere prudenti nel fare il bagno, il mare non è piatto e ci sono correnti, ma è splendido e davvero deserto. Dalle cabanas andando a este/nord si hanno 10 km di spiaggia splendida e deserta, nessuna costruzione.
Resort: le cabanas del mangrove beach cabanas sono molto belle, molto vicine al mare, decisamente consigliabili, servizio splendido, ottime colazioni, si mangia bene, si viene accuditi e coccolati dalle persone (segnalo in particolare Menik, del Beach cabanas, un angelo...). Splendie anche i chalets dell'altro resort, ma un pò più arretrati rispetto al mare.
rapporto qualità prezzo: ottimo
Devo aggiungere una ulteriore nota a loro merito. Sono giunto lì in emergenza, avevo prenotato per 5 notti in altro resort apparentemente splendido e decisamente + costoso di questo. Mia scelta personale, di cui mi pento amaramente. Giunto sul posto, ho avuto tali problemi da dovermene andare (Avevo pagato anticipatamente quasi tutto, sto questionando con questo ressot, quindi non lo cito per correttezza..). Fortunatamente, l'agenzia viaggi che mi aveva portato sin li, ha contattato il mangrove beach resort. Non avevano un posto libero per tutti e 5 i giorni perchè erano pieni, ma mi hanno accolto lo stesso dicendomi che un posto me lo avrebbero trovato, magari spostandomi due/tre volte. Sono stati bravissimi, hanno fatto i salti mortali e mi hanno sistemato benissimo.
Se per caso intendete  stare al mare nella zona di Tangalle e volete mare bello, tranquillità e servizio eccellente, a mio giudizio  questa è una ottima scelta.","Bellissimo posto, Gentilissimi.",Mangrove Beach Cabanas & Chalets,-0.5117270480634396,0.4085732826900327

We loved our luxury cabana at the beach front. The cabanas were very clean, had all the facilities we needed, perfectly put together and loved the creative outdoor showers. I have to tell the food was Michelin star standard by chef Prashanth. We loved every dish we tasted, the chef came and talked to us every time we were at the restaurant and his food presentations were very creative. Also I have to tell our private butler (Wasantha) was very attentive, always there to check we were lacking anything. By and large this hotel is 10/10 for us in terms of the location, cleanliness, staff, facilities, food etc! I wish we get to experience this type of service in Europe!

carlosheredero,"The stay in Jetwing Surf at Pottuvil was amazing. It was not only to the great hotel (the cabins are amazing, but also the swimmingpool and restaurant) and location, but also because the personal's attention was superb! Specially Jahan and Saju (the tuktuk driver), which help us on everything we needed, and where there supporting everytime we needed it. The are a big part of this 5-stars rating without any doubt.

I've been reading a lot of comments regarding the air-conditioning system inside the cabins... well that's solved! Every cabin has now air-conditioning system and it works fantastic.

If by any chance we repeat our Sri Lanka trip, we'll definitelly drop a visit to Jetwing Surf, Jahan and Saju who were impressive! Thanks team!","5-stars experience without any doubt! And yes, there's air-conditioning in every cabin!",Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,0.4085732826900327

Spend 2 nights in the month of September 2023 ,

The location was superb, you feel relaxed at the very first moment you enter the property. 
Front office staff was friendly & Check in was smooth. Each room has an individual butler.

Rooms are designed as individual villas which are spacious, clean with large bathrooms,All are equipped with mini fridge, safe, kettle,tea/coffee and air condition. The view from the room was fascinating,which kept us comfortable. 

Foods are simply delicious. They have a set menu with limited options, but all are in good portions. The restaurant staff was friendly & attentive.
They have a pool by the restaurant & enough space to walk.

A special mention on the professional service delivered by butler Pawan.A definite asset to Jetwing!

CEeaton,"3 night stay in August. Very hot but fortunately we had a room with an a/c as well as fans. Apparently not every room has a/c. Easily accommodated all of us without it feeling cramped. Lovely views from the room. We all enjoyed the novelty of the indoor & outdoor showers... nice touch. 
Food - only ate breakfasts and snacks/lunch there. Went into Aragum Bay for supper. Nice food. Slow service, probably hampered by the VIP that was staying at the same time (President of SL!) but frustrating when you have places to go! 
Nice enough pool area but it felt unfinished. Lots of concrete services and no finished tiling so could be rough on little children. 
Beach looked lovely but waves far too rough to even contemplate swimming, so we didn't go in. Life Guards were kind of advising not to go to close which was a shame. 
Huts - well serviced, roomy, had all you needed. Nice beach/surf theme going on. It all just felt a little tired. Not sure this is indicative of the Jetwing brand. It felt like the resort it had been designed to be, it wasn't operating as exactly that... either more guests are needed or more investment... probably both! 
Service was good, slow at times, but they did the job. Maybe as the president was there we got preferential treatment as everyone was on shift? We will never know but on the whole I am pleased we stayed there and travelled into Aragum Bay, over staying in Aragum itself. We befriended a Tuk tuk driver and messaged him each day via WhatsApp to get us in & out, worked well.

Also this place is located in lovely surrounding you can see a nice sun rise.. But there's need to be lot of improvements.
1. They took more than 1 hour to serve our meals and we were really hungry by that time.
2. Very limited food options, on the second day we didn't have a proper meal option choose and not that tasty too. 
3. Lots of crows and dogs inside the restaurant as well as the room terrace.
4. Geko poop is all around the room and very terrible experience. 
5. Since sand is around the area, no way to wash our foot before entering to the room(there is a cement pot, but some were without water and some places had water and dogs drunk those also no method to take out the water from the pot). so sand will come inside the room.
6. Some room essentials were not available. eg: hair dryer

Climber20280293587,"Background
Situated a 10mins tuk-tuk ride north of Arugam Bay. Located on the beach but have to go through a maze of unpaved streets to get there, and if your driver isn’t from there can struggle to find it. Its owned by the Jetwing group although lacked the usual Jetwing quality we’ve experienced in their other hotels. It prides itself on being a luxurious eco hotel, but it is far from luxurious.
Rooms
There are 20 Individual cabanas with thatched roofs. They look beautiful and you can hear the waves crashing on the beach in front of the hotel. But looks can be deceptive.
Inside the room there is large bed with mosquito net, day beds around the sides with 3 small fans on the side walls. The bathroom is open air, located in the back half of the cabana with an outdoor rain shower.
The mosquito net had holes and the fans were completely useless. It was humid during our visit and they provided no cooling effect at all.
The cabanas are separate but not overly private as the walkways to the pool and restaurant go between them, so you can see in. we had to have the blinds down most of the time. Amenities
The pool again looks nice but it’s very small and there are very few sun loungers around the pool.
One of the biggest issues was on the Friday when they had the Islamic call to prayer. Having lived in the Middle East I am more then used to the call and now hardly notice it, but sitting around a pool I did not expect to have to listen to the whole sermon. Three hours of loud wailing in Arabic. I’m unsure where it was being broadcast but it was very loud, intrusive and ruined the relaxing day we had planned.
Dining
The restaurant is located looking over the beach and looks idyllic. The menu was limited but looked interesting. Sadly the food was not at a quality to be expected from the prices being charged. We only ate here one night because of this.
Breakfast was ok but service was sooooo slow. It took over an hour each day before we even got our food. The staff had no structure to their service and items arrived if and when someone remembered. We witnessed some serious arguments/complaints from fellow guests who were far from happy about their experiences.
Staff
Uninterested and came across as having no interest in assisting you.
They did inform us of the safaris and other activities they could arrange on check in, but when we went to book we had to ask so many questions as they had no understanding about what would happen on the day of the trip.
The restaurant staff were all very pleasant but no received little to no training on how to serve.
Overall
Looks very beautiful but needs a lot of improvements. The staff need training and the eco approach of no aircon, in a warm humid country, doesn’t work. There are trading on the Jetwing name and charging a considerable amount for accommodation in Sri Lanka but it is far from worth it",Style over substance,Jetwing Surf,-0.785016352375742,-3.1121113872985475

There was only one staff member at the reception, and he was really busy. It was a Saturday, and I think they should have had more than one staff member at the reception. We waited for at least half an hour to check in, and then another half an hour to get our luggage. It was not fun atall with two toddlers. The room was big (suit15), but the bathroom door was very hard to move, and there were no locks on the balcony door.When we checked our luggage the next day, we found that a mouse or rat had sneaked into one of our bags and chewed through a bag of chocolates. We were shocked. We reported it to the hotel, and they agreed to change our room (suit 11), which was good. We stayed there for 5 days. The food was good, though sadly they only had hoppers and string hoppers available on one day. I invited my family for dinner, and it cost Rs 6000 per person, which I think is too expensive.

Aideea777,"Our journey in Sri Lanka it ended here and it was wonderful! The beach is very clean and the water also. It is a little difficult to enter and swim near the chalets, cause there are some rocks and some curents, but you should go fiew steps down the beach, like 200 m and swim there. On the beach there are a lot of palm trees and the view is amazing! The chalets in front of the beach are very clean, the only inconvenient is the mosquitoes! Be careful and take with you a mosquitoes net. I think a plus was if they had a mosquitos net on the bed. 
The breakfast is very good and fresh! The best for me in Sri Lanka. The hosts are also very friendly and nice!",The best place in Tangalle!,Mangrove Beach Cabanas & Chalets,-0.5117270480634396,-0.7649882739728273

The views were spectacular, right on the beach, and the cabin was lovely, clean and comfortable.

Although right on the beach, this end of the beach is too rough for swimming, but there is a swimming beach in town (5 min by tuk tuk) with a police-run life-saving club.

The service at Mangrove Beach Cananas was so friendly and accomodating, and the huge variety of food we tried off the large menu was all excellent.
You must try the Sri Lankan breakfast when you stay here!

FN_Grimm,"It will be really hard for any place in the world to get us closer to paradise than this: The chalets are excellent, the food is great and the surroundings (including the beach) are stunning. But the best thing is the team: They are always friendly and helpful and we really had the feeling that they enjoyed working together to make us happy. 

Just a few highlights from our stay: 
- The breakfast was excellent. I strongly recommend the Sri Lankan breakfast, which you have to order on the day before. 
- Akile (sorry for probably misspelling his name so badly) organized a trip to Udawalawe for us and called the night before to make sure everything was ok though it was his day off. The next day, the cook prepared fresh sandwiches for us at 5:30 am so that we had breakfast before our safari.  
- The food is very good. When I asked the cook how he managed to make the Egg Fried Rice to nice and fluffy, he asked me to join him in the kitchen the very next day and learn to prepare it for myself. 
- I was mocking my wife during our stay that we should eat the lobster one day (she is not so keen on sea food than I am). Somehow the staff noticed and on the last day, they organized some lobster and prepared it for our lunch without putting it on the bill. 
- The chalets are very nice, roomy and comfortable. They are cleaned every day. We especially enjoyed the couch outside of our chalet. 
- The rock pool in front of the Mangrove Beach Chalets is the only place where you can go into the sea without danger at this part of the beach. Our daughter did her first swimming without swimming wings there. 
- There are two kayaks that you can use whenever you want to explore the lagoon. We did this twice and can highly recommend it. 

Whenever me and my family will think of a paradise from now on, we will think of the five days we spent at the Mangrove Beach Chalets.",Pure Joy,Mangrove Beach Cabanas & Chalets,-0.5117270480634396,0.4085732826900327

Almost no people in the area. Fantastic food - we tried two different types of fish and prawns. Everything was amazing. 
4min walk and you can find an area with a natural barrier in the sea which protects you from the huge waves. Our kids had a lot of fun there! And we all loved hundreds of hermit crabs! Take a torch with you cause there are plenty after sunset! We found out they love fruits especially inside of a coconut shell :)
Service was great and we had a nice tuk tuk driver who took us the Tangalle center. 
Only drawback were breakfasts. Really expensive and very limited in choice and quantity. We had to take kids to a neighboring beach restaurant cause they offered pancakes and cereals with milk.

-The beach is beautiful and goes on for miles without any hotels. 
-Every evening I watched baby turtles run to the sea having hatched from their eggs on the beach,
-The guys that run the place are great - very friendly, helpful and polite. 
-The food was great and worth visiting for food alone. The chef is a talented young man.
-The cabins look out onto the beach and are very comfortable.  Each has a clean and spacious downstairs bathroom with warm water. Each room has a fan (no aircon needed as the fan is enough and temperature decreases enough overnight).
-Some mother turtles visited the beach in the night to lay eggs but I wasn’t lucky enough to see them.  Peak season should be more likely.

swissmex2016,"Yes, the location is beautiful and lonely. Well the reason, that there are not many other hotels is simple: you cannot swim in the ocean (dangerous currents), and who wants to be at the beach in the heat and have no possibility to go in the water? Therefore the beach is not attractive for new hotels. At least a hotel should have a pool, if the sea is only there to look at. The “rock pools” (mentioned in older reviews) at the nearby chalet hotel unfortunately do no longer exist, since they are now covered by sand.

The beach cabanas looked nice, but we had the garden cabanas (because there were 3 of us) below and behind of these cabanas, so we could not see the sea and it was also hot, because the wind could not get down to these cabanas. The 3rd bed was too small (even for the child) and the dirty sheets from other guests were obviously not changed for a very long time... Below that sheet was a mattrass cover with a big blood stain… The room boy did not care much about this, and he was not happy to give us new, fresh sheets at all.

As all cabanas have no windows (which looks romantic) means also, that all insects, ants etc. get in, especially in the evenings, when the light is on. Naturally, we had also 3 frogs inside and some geckos and a squirrel at night. My child almost stepped on a snake in front of the restaurant. Well, it is the nature of the mangroves…

Most of the more “luxury” hotels are out of town but as we were in Ella for just 2 nights, we wanted to be close to bars and restaurants but also have a view.

There were doors which led out to a balcony with views straight to Ella gap. Service from the staff was great, the walk to the Main Street was just minutes downhill and though may be a steep walk back for some, you can easily get a tuk tuk for those not up to it. The only improvement (and I’m clutching at straws) would be the use of a pool if you wanted to relax or cool off in the heat.  This didn’t bother us and the views, service and great breakfast more than made up for it.",Amazing views in Ella,Hotel Onrock,-0.8115644562232227,0.4085732826900327

bellemonde,"PROs: good shower waterflow, aircon works effectively, acceptable linen towel cleanliness, good size usable common area, good sized fridge. Good potential to be a decent hostel

CONs: 
slow inefficient checkin procedure. 
Wifi struggles to reach 2Mbps often unusable costing a lot of time, so plan in the cost of your own 4G data into your room price. 
collapsed bed mattress, dorm beds have no privacy curtain and room door opens straight looking at you in bed
dorm have no keys or locks; corridor looks straight into bathroom lack of privacy, only 2 shower stall per floor not sufficient; 
'kitchen' not very useful with only kettle and microwave, and has only one usable power socket you have to constantly plug and unplug between devices, staff don't seem to care to simply just change the other Sri Lanka obscure type M socket to international outlet; 
electric kettle half broken with no light indication whether it works or not; 
lack of water dispenser is a big shortcoming considering everyone has to drink bottled water in this country.

911tomislavg,"We visited C1 Fort hotel Colombo end March 2023, as a couple.

The hotel is located in the center of Colombo, close to the Fort train station and World Trade Center. The location serves as an excellent starting point for exploration of Sri Lanka's biggest city.

Modern and tidy reception floor and kind and smiling staff make sure that your needs are attended to quickly. We needed an early check-in and it was no problem to arrange it. The room was very big and featured good AC system. Prices are fair and affordable.

Guests (especially smokers) will love this place because it features very big covered rooftop terrace, outfitted with ventilators. Morning cofee or a nightcap with a view to the city you will not forget.

Right next to the hotel there is a bar where you can bring your drinks from, and just around the corner there is big souvenir shop (Laksala – State owned gift and souvenir shop) with low prices. If you are starting your Sri Lanka tour from here it may be advisable to buy some souvenirs here, because the same items will be considerably more expensive if you buy them elsewhere around the country.

Currency exchange point is conveniently located 20m from the hotel entrance, tuk tuk ride as well. The Fort district with restaurants is 5 min walk from the hotel.

When we come back to Colombo, we will certainly come back to stay at this place, there is no better recommendation.","Modern, clean, affordable, great location, great staff - recommended",C 1 Colombo Fort,-0.9763188653943536,0.4085732826900327

surokgogog,"Отелю четвёрка. Приехали серфить, отсыпаться, вам сюда. В межсезонье откровенно скучно, будучи на карантине, некуда сходить, но это минусы карантина

Отдельная благодарность менеджменту отеля, что не смотря на два переноса, сохранили и предоставили нам номер. 

Пляж супер, волны по вечерам потряс, отель по ланкийски уютен, номер классный по местным меркам.

Минусов выделил два, и хотел бы чтобы менеджмент и хозяева с этим разобрались:

1. Ресторан.
А) цены сильно выше чем за забором. Мелкие примеры: лобстер 13000 лкр за кг, за забором 4000. Креветки в велигаме 1200 за кг, здесь 1300 200 грамм, завышение по фруктам ещё больше, тарелка раз в пять дороже чем реально стоит
Б) нестабильное качество. Кальмары плохо чистят, креветки в devils shripms с хвостиками, креветки то 6штук, то 11штук в порции, кальмары то мелкие, то большие, яйца Бенедикт в меню есть, но всегда переваренные, тунец вечно пережаренный %(хотя последний раз был великолепен) 
В) при нас произошла замена команды, официанты стали внимательней, на кухне качественно улучшилось приготовление, но местами, так в фетучини большие креветки заменили на мелкие, а один раз темпура креветки откровенно были кислые (жена сказала фритюрное масло умерло) 
В сухом остатке, если бы мы не были на карантине, я бы не часто здесь ел: дорого по ланкийским меркам, непонятно что принесут. За эти деньги (а цены то московские) качество должно быть как минимум стабильно))

2. Мушки и вороны.
А) сэндфлайс, люди любящие загорать столкнутся с укусами мелких мошек. Сначала нарывает место укуса, потом гнойник, потом краснеет, в общем чудо. Весь искусан, в крапинку, чешется страшно. В отеле нет средств от этого, но все знают о проблеме. Спасли местный русский чат, дали рекомендацию, привезли из аптеки. Но в целом, мошки продолжают кусать, ничего не меняется. Считаю, что территория отеля должна быть обработана от этой напасти. Соседний мариотт при нас вчера обработал
Б) вороны. В отпуске хочется просыпаться от звука волн или пения птиц, но никак не карканья ворон, коих здесь сотни. Как можно было допустить гнездовье ворон на пальмах отеля, не пойму. меня обгадили дважды, один раз в обед полностью загадили лежаки и наши вещи

Душевному персоналу личное спасибо от нашей семьи, официанты, которые рулили кухней в трудные времена: Хали, Сугар, Ирадж. Большая личная благодарность инструктор по серфу Сохану, он нас поставил на волны. Жаль, что уехал за пять дней до нашего отъезда.",Противоречивые ощущения в межсезонье,Weligama Bay Resort,-0.6585224458083334,-0.7649882739728273

KarolisK24,"The hotel itself is decent. Rooms are spacious and clean, restaurants serves good food right in front of the sea. Also, close to the harbour, perfect for whale watching.

Giving 3 stars mostly because of staff. We have had multiple communication issues. A couple of examples:
1. When we arrived, our driver was told accommodation for him will not be provided (he would have paid). It made no sense, because he was in the Bio travel bubble with us and could not stay outside of the hotel in the community. When asked to explain this, the person at the reception said that he was told this by his manager. I asked for the manager, who could only say ""we don't provide driver accommodation"", without explaining why nor how this affects the Bio bubble regulations.
2. We wanted to do laundry, so asked when will we get it back. We were assured it will be the same day (I explicitly asked about the timing twice). After giving the laundry, my wife noticed the form, which indicated that laundry submitted after 10am will be returned the next day. She pointed it out to the staff, who then confirmed that the laundry will be returned the next day instead (felt like my wife is doing their job familiarizing herself with the rules).

Not the place to choose, if you expect to only ask for things once.","Decent Level 1 hotel, but staff needs to improve",Weligama Bay Resort,-0.6585224458083334,-1.9385498306356874

Die Lage des Resorts ist ideal. In nur wenigen Minuten ist man im buddhistischen Zentrum oder in der Stadt, dennoch ist die Umgebung angenehm ruhig. Nur wenige Meter vom Hotel entfernt beginnt der Regenwald, was Naturfreunden die Möglichkeit gibt, direkt vor der Haustür spannende Ausflüge zu unternehmen.

Das Essen im Restaurant ist großzügig portioniert und schmeckt ausgezeichnet. Der Hotelmanager und das gesamte Servicepersonal sind äußerst freundlich und zuvorkommend, was den Aufenthalt noch angenehmer macht.",Natur und Stadtnähe in einem,Nature Walk Resort,-0.6249469027071077,0.4085732826900327

Unamiga,"We have spent one night here during our weekend trip to Kandy. The best about this hotel is good kitchen with European food (beef steak for example was good) and a restaurant on the top with stunning view. Room had AC and beds were comfortable. 

However, in the bathroom there is no wall or curtain on the shower, so water is all around the bathroom, and also in the morning there were no hot water. And in the middle of the night we were woken because of loud sound the pipes make - they seem to be old. 

Anyways I would still recommend for a short stay on weekend if you only need to sleep one night and leave it is good value for its price I think.","Great view and kitchen, but bathroom issues",Nature Walk Resort,-0.6249469027071077,-0.7649882739728273

113sachinp,"This hotel was booked by my travel planner for a one night stay at Kandy. We checked in late afternoon and the room allotted to us was neat & clean. As I had instructed, there was an extra cot & bed readied. There was also a mosquito net neatly tied up above the king size bed. The bathroom was clean and had the basic toiletries in place. The room had a working intercom, but no Television. Perhaps it could be the hotel policy to avoid TV in rooms, and I appreciate them on this decision. The room also had big French windows from where I could get a view of a very beautiful sun rise in Sri Lanka. After an early morning landing, plus around five hours of car ride this hotel room helped me to have a very peaceful sleep.

The hotel also has a restaurant on the top floor. The food options are good and I had a sumptuous breakfast in the morning. The view from the restaurant area is much better than those from the rooms. At a distance we could see a statue of Buddha meditating facing the hills (with a mobile phone tower right next to him). The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel does not have a lift, and appreciate the bell boys who helped us with our luggage. 

The hotel even though very close to the Kandy Lake and the Tooth Relic temple is in a very quite area. The hotel staff who provided our morning tea, requested us to be wary of the monkeys. And he was quite right, we had the first monkey guest who wanted to share our morning tea which was laid out in the balcony.",A good hotel - fits the budget and neat & clean,Nature Walk Resort,-0.6249469027071077,-0.7649882739728273

Fairway Colombo is a modern business hotel; clean and very comfortable, with probably the best shower I had whilst touring Sri Lanka.

D8499RLscotts,"Wow, where do I start? Fortunately, our dear neighbours back in Melbourne are longtime friends of the owners, Kalika and Preethika and this is how we came across Sigiriya Kings Resort. After also checking other guests reviews, we knew this was the place to stay whilst visiting Sigiriya. From the time we arrived we felt and were treated like family. Yes we had a link to the resort, however you could soon see that the treatment we received is what all guests experience. 
We were given the best advice on what to do whilst spending 3 nights there. 
The rooms are positioned, looking at the two rocks you can climb and the resort is so remote you feel like there is nothing else around, except for the tremendous range of wildlife. From walking around the grounds to climbing the rocks there is plenty to do and once back at the resort you can simply relax and absorb the surrounds. 
The staff at the resort deliver what I would say is the best service I’ve received whilst travelling the world. This is due to the fact they love what they’re doing. You can see it in the way they go about there day.
The food at the restaurant is amazing from Sri Lankan cuisine to Western.

The food was all ala carte i think due to season but either way it was basically world class.

irmaberg77,"For a relaxing holiday, it's best to head south to the vicinity of Weligama, a favorite spot for surfers. Here, Cape Weligama (Relais & Chateaux) stands out as the premier destination. This renowned hotel boasts 39 boutique villas and suites spread across 5 hectares of a former coconut grove on the dramatically picturesque Cape Weligama. The primary draw of this location is the stunning views, views, and more views.

The Ocean Terrace Restaurant, where guests gather for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is perched on a cliff, providing an unparalleled vantage point to take in some of the best scenery imaginable. 

Cape Weligama also offers three secret spots—secluded areas perfect for watching the sunset. Each spot is equipped with a table and chairs, and can be reserved for a romantic lunch or dinner. 

The villas themselves are spacious, each covering at least 130 square meters, and are built in the local architectural style. Each villa features its own private pool (shared between two or three villas) and a spacious terrace furnished with a table, sun loungers, and a sofa. It's an idyllic spot to sip tea while listening to the tunes of Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.

The cuisine at Cape Weligama is another highlight. Talented chefs deliver an impressive culinary experience starting with breakfast. However, the evening meals truly showcase their skills. A standout feature is the Chef's Table at the Tableau restaurant, where a seven-course dinner is prepared before your eyes. This culinary journey includes appetizers, soups, sorbets, main courses, and desserts, making for an unforgettable dining experience.

Chef Ishara Wijesinghe has honed his craft in various countries including Dubai over a 20-year career. He returned to his homeland to perfect his skills in Sri Lankan cuisine, infusing it with European gastronomic techniques. The result is exceptional—his cooking method could easily earn a Michelin star. Guests can ask about the secrets of local cuisine, get excellent recipes, and engage in conversations about global culinary traditions and life in general.

For those seeking adventure, Cape Weligama offers a variety of activities, from surfing lessons and whale watching excursions to guided tours of nearby tea plantations and historic sites. In conclusion, Cape Weligama is not just a place to stay; it's a destination that offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and immersive cultural experiences.",Wonderful Stay,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,-0.3461918123085593,0.4085732826900327

I was on a business trip under the invitation of one of my valuable clint to cover an evening hosting. Out of no where this Sales director appears in the middle of the meals and insisted that he wanted some coverage done for his personal usage, which is not part of my briefing form my client. In few mints time again in the middle of me having my dinner, he pulled me out and wanted me to show him the coverage I did so far, and started lecturing me about my duty  by asking me to come to a corner. That director and his colleague didn't know any one who is at his property is guest and to be polite if he wants something done, instead they was so arrogant, annoying had guts to disturbed the gusts dinner in the middle of it too . Hence I decided to check out from Cape Weligama immediately and and which I did at 11/30 PM mid night.

Piswig,"After having stayed twice both at Ceylon Tea Trails and Wild Coast Tented Lodge I finally wanted to experience the „Sea“-part of the Resplendent Ceylon Hotels. I am always skeptical about Conde Nast Traveller Hot-List Hotels but Cape Weligama really is a true gem! The service was so great and I loved the tranquility and general atmosphere of this place. The Hotel is immersed in its surroundings not separated from it, giving exit to the surrounding beaches. Everything was beautifully maintained and clean. I was upgraded to a villa, which I loved. Sajith showed me the property and did an amazing job. Since I unfortunately only had one night he saved me a lot of time by explaining and showing everything to me directly after arrival. He also made sure that I knew how to contact him, if I had any questions or problems. 
The food was also delicious. I will definitely return and can highly recommend staying here. Thank you very much!",Not to be missed,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,-0.3461918123085593,0.4085732826900327

The highlight of our stay was your incredible staff! They were genuinely interested in our comfort and always went above and beyond to make our stay the best ever. Lahiru, Mahendra - our curator and Pradeep were so warm and friendly and we truly appreciate their efforts. Manula from F&B was the absolute star during our stay - he honestly went above and beyond and was the most pleasant person to deal with! Manula assisted us both during breakfast and dinner and at the end of our stay we felt like he was part of our family! My husband accidentally cut his toe on a stone and Manula rushed to get ice and a band aid and was so lovely during the situation. 

As a Front Office Manager myself in Melbourne, I truly appreciate and value outstanding service in the hospitality industry and am so proud to call myself Sri Lankan when I experience stays such as these. Your staff truly seemed like they loved their job as it shows by the way they work!

I can easily say that my husband and I will be dreaming of our honeymoon at Cape Weligama for months and years to come.

Mel4637,"This is the most incredible place we’ve ever been! From the incredible hospitality, to the cliffside views looking at the surfers below, to the delicious Sri Lankan and Western breakfasts and dinners, and to the beautiful rooms, this place deserves all of the accolades. This was our last stop of our (a couple) Sri Lanka trip and it was the perfect ending. Shaun was absolutely wonderful, greeted us at check in and hosted us the entire trip, ensuring our stay was top notch! He was a gem. The sincere nature of all of the staff also did not go unnoticed. All of the butlers, to bartenders, to maintenance around the property to the managers, were genuine and sincere to see you. Another highlight was tasting the different fruit or flavor infused arracks at the Surf Bar onsite. The drinks the bartenders made with those arracks were unreal! 

We stayed in the master suite, and the room was huge with a large private deck with seating. The all wood walk in closet was a nice touch to tuck away our suitcases out of the way, and the rainfall shower was the best treat after a swim at the beach nearby. The shower room also turns into a steam room, although we didn’t try it. And the half moon infinity pool! Highly recommend a swim there at dusk, as it’s pretty incredible to watch the sun go down and surfers below. 

All in all, our hands down favorite part of our trip was Cape Weligama! There’s not enough words to say how special this stay was. We will be returning in the future!",Seven stars!,Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,-0.3461918123085593,0.4085732826900327

DoogiDee,"This was our 2nd time on the South coast of Sri Lanka, previously there in 2013, and it is just as beautiful as it was but much busier with more tuk tuks, scooters, surfers, everything really!
The Cape Weligama hotel is at the luxury end of the market price wise but mostly lives up to expectations. The villa was beautiful and we shared the private pool with only one other villa (tbh we had it to ourselves most of the time) and housekeeping by Sadasheena and Vimukthi was fantastic. We were there for 13 nights, started on half board for one week then cancelled that for the 2nd to give us a bit more freedom of choice as the evening menu did not appear to change.
We got out and about using a brilliant local tuk tuk driver, Viraj +94 773969530, who was a very safe, honest and reliable driver and I highly recommend using him. He lives with his family a few hundred yards from the hotel and would appreciate the work.
Inoka looked after us on arrival and Madushan was invaluable in making our departure so easy and stress free.
All in all we had a fantastic relaxing holiday with temperatures always around 31/31 degrees so landing back in London at 5 degrees was a shock, remember to take a jumper, we didn’t!","Fantastic holiday, thanks to all",Cape Weligama - Relais & Chateaux,-0.3461918123085593,0.4085732826900327

Accomodation is beautiful and cleaning regimes ensure everything is always spotless. The food is outstanding from the breadless bendedict at breakfast to the local crustaceans at dinner.

Food excellent large choice. A number of items repeatedly not available - would suggest amending the menu.
